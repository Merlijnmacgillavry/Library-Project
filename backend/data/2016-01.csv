(mentor)","2016","Frequently compelled by their knowledge and governance legislations, architects act as agents of expertise and impose top down solutions, in the form of fixed typologies, to bottom up and often temporary problems. Together with the fact that, in a fast paced, open source and migrating society, we still rely on the public-private dichotomy, results in the prematurely termination of any spatial emergent affordances. In order to adapt to the new social and cultural shift, architecture needs to arrest the terms of public and private and embrace a new spatial ontology that arises out of the Spinozian natura naturans and not natura naturata. The present paper investigates the possibility of achieving such an alteration in the design of spaces, through the use of a transcendental and phaseal common realm.","assemblage theory; field conditions; intra-action; public; private; common; architecture","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Architecture and The Built Environment","Architectural Theory","","AR2AT030 Architecture Theory Thesis","",""

(mentor); Avissar, I. (mentor); Weaver, T. (mentor)","2016","Ritual as prescribed by tradition has long been instrumental in defining the essence of ethnicity. It is governed by accepted rules, values and behavioral norms embedded in daily routine through repetition. Contemporary Malays have inherited rituals, dating since the 7th century, known as ‘adat’. The advent of Malacca Sultanate in the 15th century revolutionized the rituals to their highest mature state, defining the essence of ‘Malayness’ through its civilization; by strengthening the Islamic belief, Malay language and traditions. Nevertheless, modernization and cross-cultural influences have created multiple readings of rituals. Hence, contemporary Malays are paradoxical, both traditionalist and modern when it comes to the practice of rituals. This is due to the fact that Malay rituals are practiced in everyday life, rather than symbolically performed. This is also implies a strong correlation between traditional principles and contemporary lifestyles. Perhaps it means that their root remains essential to Malays, despite their inevitable evolution along different living conditions. The traditional Malay house is a living artifact of how rituals are framed in space. Through its layout the notion of rituals is projected in everyday routine, preserving Malay values and manners. In the past, the house allowed Malay to be ‘decent’, in terms of social life, domestic culture, ethics, and religion. Gender segregation and sitting rituals have been since then the most important rituals projected in its interior layout. This has remained almost the same for 400 years, while its exterior façade absorbing various influences. Therefore, rituals embedded into the daily life result in persistent spatial qualities, regardless of a house’s location or stylistic influences. The evolution from the traditional house to a modern high-rise apartment has triggered multiple critiques regarding the performance of rituals. One may think that a generic modern layout allows the practice of ‘zero’ rituals. Yet, it allows rituals to be transposed into ordinary domestic objects framing the life of its inhabitants. This phenomenon is explicit in analytical studies of modern Malay apartments, where furniture and everyday objects are re-appropriated to suit rituals. Hence, this project is a manifesto that intends to canonize ordinary objects as ritualistic artifacts, fully acknowledging Malaysia’s contemporary modern context. The modern Malay house -now in an urban setting- becomes a background platform that allows the individual to perform rituals through singular objects. Three scenarios based on the daily life of a modern Malay family are created as representations of specific rituals. The first scenario -‘Who Is Your Best Friends?’- is a depiction of ‘serambi’ or reception deck which emphasise rituals of gender segregations in a community. The second scenario -‘Secret Recipe’- portrays an island kitchen cabinet that highlights the essence of sitting rituals in Malay dining etiquette. Finally the third scenario -‘Hide & Seek’- intends to emphasise rituals related to different gender needs within a family. As such, the manifesto is a critical tool in order to rethink the position of rituals in the modern Malay house. The scenarios may be exaggerations of reality, however this allows Malays to realize that rituals are part of their daily routine, no matter where and when they are performed to sustain the agenda of ’decent’ Malay.","Ritual; House; Malay","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Architecture and The Built Environment","The Berlage Center for Advanced Studies in Architecture and Urban Design","","The Berlage MSc in Architecture and Urban Design","",""

(mentor)","2016","Road safety has been the subject of interest for research from the time the first automotive was invented. Safety has been characterized by many factors but the most prominent is maintaining control over the vehicle motion in all situations. Modern safety systems especially Antilock Braking System (ABS) in combination with Electronic Stability Control (ESC) has brought down the uncontrollable occasions in driving and therefore, sheltering the passengers from accidents. This system ensures the control of the vehicle while braking in varying surface conditions by keeping the friction coefficient close to optimal which helps in preventing wheel lock up and minimizing the braking distance. The current methods employ complex heuristic rules and optimization is still required in algorithm development. The ABS provides reference pressure signals to be achieved in different wheel brake cylinders to a low level controller termed as the brake pressure controller. This low level controller needs to be as precise as possible considering the challenges of hydraulic line characteristics and unavailability of states. Some researchers have investigated this area earlier and there have been performance issues which are yet to be solved. Of these, the core issue was the inability of the controller to adapt to variable conditions. Hence, an adaptive control approach is proposed to this problem. The project aims to optimize the functioning of the brake pressure controller. This report will introduce the reader to the test vehicle and its braking system to be controlled. It will also identify the objectives of the controller and learn the limitations of the hydraulic circuit. Further, 2 models derived from the literature will be compared from analysis on experimental data. Finally, the formulation of adaptive control algorithm and the implementation strategy along with control of essential secondary components will be addressed. This implementation of reliable brake pressure controller along with its performance evaluation will serve as a foundation for realization for future novel ABS algorithms.","adaptive; brake pressure; controller; automotive; brake systems; hydraulic control; RLS; Recursive Least Squares; hydraulic modulator; ABS; vehicle implemenation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Delft Center for Systems and Control","","Control Engineering","",""

Requirements from the Dutch building legislation, on topics as insulation, noise level, ventilation and daylight. Comfort requirements, on topics as temperature, daylight and air refreshment/ventilation. With these requirements in mind I was able to do a project specific façade engineering for the case and make a comparison between a project specific façade engineering and a product façade engineering. The outcome was positive to a project specific engineering. After this design process and the interviews with the different companies (ABT, MVRDV, Schüco, FBA, Sorba and Alcoa) I found a way how to achieve a project specific design where the concessions the architect has to do are as little as possible. This in contrast with the current process where the architects has to do a lot of unwanted concessions.","project specific; design process; product specific","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2016-01-26","Architecture and The Built Environment","Building Technology","","Facade design","",""

The reverberant times are very high due to the little amount of absorbing surfaces and some frequencies gain a higher G-strength then other frequencies. This is for a part due to the dimensions of the spaces. For example; churches with concave surfaces and very high ceilings. The other part is caused by the materialisation of the buildings. The materials are mainly chosen because of their constructive or aesthetic properties. The masonry and concrete hardly absorb any frequencies, which causes a high reverberation times, and wooden floors basically absorb a little bit of the low tones (due to the resonance frequency). However, some buildings could be very suitable for theatres and arts centres because of their central location in cities, but due to the poor acoustic quality this is a big design challenge. In the design question, two important demands conflict with each other; Both the cultural value of the existing building and the acoustic quality demands large surfaces. Cultural value needs to be seen by the users, but sound needs to be absorbed and reflected in a complex way.

(mentor); Visser, A.A. (mentor)","2016","This graduation assignment is created by my interest in photography, mobile photography and travelling. The direction of this project is to create a meaningful service or product for people that travel in combination with mobile photography. The start of this project was very open and the method ViP was used to define a future context for a new service or product. The first phase was very explorative and the domain: mobile photography on holiday was explored in many different directions. The broad domain helped to discover many possibilities for design directions and prevented limitation in any direction. This extensive research included literature studies, interviews and questionnaires. Interesting directions showed up together with states, principles, trends and developments. The two most striking findings for this context is the importance of the balance between individualistic and social behavior and the smooth transition between online and offline attention. Besides that, people will have in the future more need to get reliable information and resources at any moment in time at any place. People live more efficient and fast and time is precious, therefore people like to communicate fast and efficient. Communication will become more visual and because of the digitalization and technical developments more accessible for many people. Sharing content on internet, the rise of social network sites and the increase in use of visual content contributes to more awareness and prudence on what is actually real. Therefore visual content has to be trustworthy. Travelling and going on holiday is something people always will do and need. Because every tourist and traveller is different it is necessary to personalise a trip or holiday. Tourists in 2018 will have many more possibilities to make a trip that match their wishes. Travelling and holiday is all about experiences. You see new things, eat unfamiliar food and you try to blend in a foreign culture. Photography is very powerful and images can express these experiences more than words can do. These findings resulted in a vision for a new service/product of the future. The evolved design direction or statement is part of this vision and it is a guideline for further design decisions: “I want people to travel with more pleasure, by giving more meaning to pictures they take”. Besides this statement an analogy for the desired interaction is made: “It should feel like your friends are with you while travelling”. The interaction between product/service and user is defined further by interaction qualities. The design direction is narrowed down by describing product characteristics. Several design ideas were created and combined to one concept that fits the vision most. A user test with a prototype and an online questionnaire helped to detail the concept. The final concept is the application HoyJoy. Travellers can capture experiences by photo, film and text to create meaningful recommendations to share with friends. Pictures that are uploaded represent your experience; they are honest and made with a mobile camera. HoyJoy is a home for inspiration on what to do while travelling. A trustworthy community of friends gives information on where to go. This app helps to discover places that are worth visiting. Browsing though the experiences is very visual and a choice is based on first impression. Recommendations of friends can be saved in the wishlist. Travellers can look forward to the saved places they want to visit, or they can look for inspiration at the moment they need it. This project ends with recommendations for further development of this concept and an evaluation of the applied ViP method and results of the final concept.","photography; application; design","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","2018-01-29","Industrial Design Engineering","Industrial Design","","Master of Science Design for Interaction","",""

Two urban waterfronts have been selected for the study: Frihamnen in Gothenburg and Stadswerven in Dordrecht. The two waterfronts have to be adapted to be able to cope with the risk of flooding. This research investigates how property developers are engaged in the adaptation of the waterfronts and what features influences their behavior. The engagement of the property developers depends on several features, which can be divided into internal and external features. The internal features influencing the behavior of the property developers are their business model and the partnership agreement they have with the urban planners from the municipality. The external features consist of five conditions: The conditions set by the urban planners, through the master and zoning plan, the building permits and as an owner of the land they can influence the property developers’ behavior. The economic conditions in a city and country, influences the housing demand and prices, which have an impact on the development decisions of the property developers. The housing demand and prices are also influenced by the public flood risk awareness. which are the social conditions. The laws, regulations and interest of the national and regional government are steering and controlling the actions of the urban planners and therefore indirectly influencing the behavior of the property developers, which are the institutional conditions. Finally are the physical conditions influencing the adaptations and the nature of the adaptations that are needed. From the case studies three main features that influences the property developers in Gothenburg and Dordrecht to adapt the developments were identified: the business model, long term property developers have more incentives to adapt the developments to avoid damages. The partnership agreement the property developers have with the urban planners from the municipality, if they are given too much freedom, they will use this to make the most profit. Which does not always lead to the development of adapted buildings. The economic conditions: the housing demand and prices are influencing the adaptation investments property developers can afford and are willing to take. An understanding of the features and how they influence the behavior of the property developers, will contribute in the development of resilient waterfronts.","urban waterfronts; flood risk; adaptation; property developers & comparative case study","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Architecture and The Built Environment","Management in the Built Environment","","","",""

(mentor)","2016","As semiconductor devices shrink further, the effects of process variation become more and more pronounced. They negatively impact the speed and power consumption of Integrated Circuits (ICs). Traditionally, a worst-case based design methodology is used to compensate for their potential impact. For modern technology this method means an increased penalty in area and power consumption. Therefore, Variability Resilient Schemes (VRSs) are introduced. They are used to improve the speed of ICs with slow processing and decrease the power consumption of ICs with fast processing. Thanks to these techniques a Better-Than-Worst-Case (BTWC) design methodology can be used. It improves performance, area, and power consumption. The work in this thesis is performed within the Variability Resilient Architectures (VRA) project at NXP Semiconductors. In this project the potential of body biasing, clock stretching, and error avoidance flip-flops as VRSs is investigated. Circuits with VRSs run closer to their optimal performance. This means more extensive testing is necessary compared to worst-case based designs. Also, the usage of error avoidance flip-flops bring new testability challenges. In order for designs with VRSs to be interesting yield and testability need to be high enough. This thesis evaluates the testability challenges of the VRSs used in the VRA project. A cost model is proposed to compare the cost of worst-case based designs with designs with VRSs. The testability of the error avoidance flip-flop is evaluated and a solution is proposed for stuck-at and path delay testing of the error output. Finally, the potential of body biasing to compensate process variation is investigated, by comparing the performance of a worst-case based design and a BTWC design, which has an area reduction of 25%. The performance of both designs is compared by measuring path delays in both simulations and measurements. It is shown that with around 0.2 V forward body biasing the performance of the BTWC design is comparable to the worst-case design.","Variability Resilience; Process Variation; VLSI; Design for Test","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Microelectronics & Computer Engineering","","","",""

(mentor)","2016","At the height of its production, Dutch architecture has come to the point where the main criteria for a project’s success is its compelling concept, which in turn manifests itself through the architectural story. The project questions the capacity of architectural storytelling, which is exactly the topic that should be discussed in this story-based environment. . “A Flat Tale” is an exploration of the Dutch visual culture, through architecture as a primary lens of discovery. The project consists of 3 component parts. They represent three levels of complexity of architectural representation as well as three steps in the development and maturation of narratives and architectural projects. They are based on the investigation of the Netherlands, Dutch architectural projects and narratives. “A Good Life ABC”, establishes the grammar of Dutch architecture. It represents the simplest way of giving and receiving knowledge. Letters of the alphabet are paired with images that form examples of objects and elements of the Dutch built environment. Drawn in a reductive manner, and with the use of only primary colours, these objects form emblematic images, striped of any specificity, that represent only themselves and their Dutchness. They become symbols of Dutch identity. After establishing the grammar, “A Flat Tale”, forms the syntax. It is an architectural picturebook which uses images to convey spatial narratives, and text to convey temporal ones. Some aspects of the story are made explicit through images and some through text creating a complementary relationship with the two forms of storytelling. This, in the words of Perry Nodelman, results in a relationship between pictures and texts in picturebooks that tends to be ironic where each element speaks about matters on which the other is silent. The story is based on the development of Almere and it is used to establish ideas that form generative theoretical elements of Dutch architecture and culture, such as concept, export, identity, welfare, subsidies, etc. The third part represents the most mature phase of developing an architectural idea. It uses architectural polemic through the format of an architectural journal, titled “Pitch”. Dutch architectural stories are clear and relatable. Architects do not try to mystify the process through complex semantic constructs, but rather use metaphoric descriptions that allude to known spaces, places and experiences. “Pitch” examines Dutch architectural projects through the use of narrative, argumentation and criticism. “Pitch” ends with a fictional project. It is set in an undefined future. It is a utopian, infrastructural, urban and architectural project of a mountain in the Netherlands. Using only text, diagrams and allusions to the project (in the form of “infiltrators” placed in the first two parts), the project questions and tests the capacity of architectural storytelling. As a conclusion, operations performed in all three parts of the project are compiled and collated in a final appendix.

Approaching the topic of architectural representation through both its lexical and visual qualities allows for the elucidation of three main categories: the diagram and the emblematic object, the architectural design project and its narrative and the architectural essay.

(mentor); Herder, J.L. (mentor)","2016","Background: Compliant mechanisms have the advantage of low weight, no lubrication, no wear and no friction. These are good properties for a mechanical transmission. But large range of motion (ROM) in compliant mechanisms is a challenge. If the ends of a long shell with only a transverse curvature are connected, a two-fold closed-loop tape spring (tape loop) is created which is a rectilinear joint with an large ROM. The objective of this thesis is to present and analyze a new transmission concept formed by connected tape loops in a configuration that transmits a tension force around a body. Method: A model of the force deflection behavior along the two main axes of a tape loop was made and verified with experiments. This model was implemented in a model of a transmission formed by connected tape loops with a tendon under a relative angle. This model was also experimentally validated. Results: The models and experiments show the same kind of for deflection behaviour with increasing stiffness for larger deflections, but can differ up to 50%. For a 103mm tape loop a ROM of 39mm was obtained. The measured efficiency of the transmission is between 91.6% and 96.8%, and is depending on the load. Conclusions: The behaviour of the transmission can be described in terms of the design parameters. It was found that there is a trade-off between ROM and stiffness and that they scale with the size of the transmission.","Compliant Mechanisms; tape spring","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","PME","","MSD","",""

(mentor)","2016","Air traffic noise, especially during the aircraft take-off and landing, has been universally acknowledged as a nuisance, for which reason, the International Civil Aviation Organization(ICAO) has ratified articles and established specifications aiming at the attenuation of air traffic noise, such as the Annex 16. The implementation of large bypass ratio turbo-fan engines on civil aircrafts and the application of designs such as engine nacelle and chevron nozzle have shifted the attention of noise control to the deployment of high-lift devices during take-off and landing. Source control is proved to be effective in the reduction of aeronautical noise. Traditional aeroacoustic assessments rely mainly on microphone (array) measurements and instantaneous flow fields obtained from CFD. However, the former fails in providing the mechanism of sound generation and the latter becomes prohibitive in the operating Reynolds number range of real aircrafts. Previous investigations have validated the causality between the unsteady transverse velocity in the wake of the high-lift devices and the far-field pressure fluctuation. This thesis is a continuation of the previous study, focusing on investigating the feasibility of noise prediction of high-lift devices based on experimental data obtained by time-resolved PIV . A model of NACA 0015 airfoil with Gurney flap of the height of 6% the chord length has been investigated by means of 2D time-resolved PIV in combination with simultaneous microphone measurements. The Gurney flap is a simplified model of the high-lift devices with more complex structure in real application. The experimental parameters were selected such that the source of sound can be treated as compact and consequentially guaranteed the applicability of both the distributed and the lumped formulation of the Curle's aeroacoustic analogy. In the first step, the time evolving pressure field was deduced from the velocity field measured by 2D TR-PIV, by the Poisson-based solver for quasi-2D incompressible flows. Pressure on the surfaces of the airfoil then constitutes the source terms of the distributed formulation of Curle's analogy and the corresponding far-field noise was evaluated. In the second step, the aerodynamic loads of the airfoil were evaluated from the velocity field by means of momentum balance, which were then used in the lumped formulation for noise prediction. The spanwise coherence length evaluated from the cross-plane flow visualizations was applied for the correction of 3D effect. Both formulations of the Curle's analogy yield noise evaluation of fair agreement with the simultaneous microphone measurements. All the calculated far-field noise power spectra reproduce the peak at K\'{a}rm\'{a}n vortex shedding frequency, which agrees well with the microphone measurements. The pressure fluctuations yielded by distributed formulation of the Curle's analogy are somehow damped due to the Gaussian smoothing applied to the velocity fields in the process of pressure reconstruction for the elimination of spurious spatial derivatives. Such damping effect can be circumvented by the lumped formulation, since the pressure is only evaluated on control volume boundaries in the locating in the far-wake, where 3D motions are weaker than in the region in direct proximity of the airfoil trailing edge. The high frequency components in the computed acoustic spectra are the most affected by the experimental and numerical errors. The coherence length correction reduce the over-estimation of the predicted noise levels with respect to the microphone measured ones. However, there still exists room for improvement in the procedure of coherence length correction. Concludingly, this thesis proved TR-PIV an effective approach in the noise prediction of airfoil with Gurney flap and stepped out the first step in PIV-based aeroacousitic investigations of the high-lift devices. Application of the approach on high-lift devices with more complex configurations would be a prospective continuation of the current study.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","Aerodynamics and Wind Energy","","Aerodynamics","",""

The teenagers and young adults often lack a connection to their neighbourhood and the other inhabitants. Consequently, they feel misunderstood and by lack of ambition they reside mostly on the streets, hanging around or worse – engage in (small) crime. In this project a technological laboratory in the library Schilderswijk has been set up with and for the youth of the Schilderswijk. By attaching to the recent trend of the maker movement the youngsters from the Schilderswijk have undergone empowerment, unlocking themselves to find their (hidden) talents and develop their skills. Through continuous involvement of the participants ownership of the lab has been achieved, ultimately leading to ambassadorship and recruitment of new members. The technological laboratory has been equipped with “Biebboxes”, small bookshaped and sized containers that have been constructed in three different versions: ""Locality"", ""Actuality"" and ""Diversity"". The Biebboxes contain various assignments, workshops, inspirational material and random stimuli which are correspondent with the theme of the Biebbox. The contents of the Biebboxes provide the participants of the laboratory with a range of diverse assignments and workshops to work with. By providing different types of stimuli the Biebboxes are engaging and innovative. The contents provoke the participants to think about the possibilities the present techniques at the laboratory offer, ultimately inspiring them to create new Biebbox-content themselves. In this way the recruitment of new members and creation of Biebbox-content is self-sustainable. Lastly, a model is constructed that enables librarians to repeat the process of the current project in order to start other “New Dutch Maker”-laboratories.","empowerment; co-creation; co-design; social design; maker movement; FabLab; Schilderswijk; power district; The Hague; library; product-service-system; PSS; New Dutch Makers; biebbox; biebboxes; talent","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Industrial Design","","Master of Science Design for Interaction","",""

(mentor); Weaver, T. (mentor); Milani, S. (mentor)","2016","In Russian society the value of the collective and the common was always very high, even before the USSR. This collectivism expressed itself on many different levels, but spatially it was especially representative in the form of the banya, a traditional Russian steam bath. Through the figure of the banya, collective nakedness and communal intimacy became a cultural condition, and one that developed though many historical periods. As a type, the banya evolved from the traditional extension to a house, through a collective space in the USSR, to a contemporary, multifunctional entertainment space. Banya contains myths in it, whether it is a creature Bannik from a Slavic folklore or a communist myth. In many ways, the history of the country can be seen through the transformation of this type. Even though the banya is a traditional type in Russia, it is only ever defined by its interiors and structure, and never codified or celebrated as a distinct architectural form. Despite its cultural and infrastructural significance, this type has not been studied before. The aim of this project is therefore to document and analyse the history of the banya, to create an archaeology of this type and understand how it remains relevant as both an interior form, and even as a urban model in contemporary Russia. Therefore the archival research is been made and the timeline of development of that type is documented. The architectural taxonomy of the type was based on archives of Saint Petersburg. This city is said to be a city of Banyas. Historically, the land on which the city sits was a swamp, reclaimed by a polder – artificial, experimental land. It is a fake city. The urban facades make Saint Petersburg look like the city of Peter the Great, but when you look inside any arch you see Dostoevsky city inside. It is also a city that has both, Dutch and Italian qualities. Perhaps the only Russian thing about St Petersburg are the banyas. All banyas from the archival material are exist or existed in Saint Petersburg, which makes this city a perfect example that contains all this patterns of spaces and different degrees of shared intimacy in the city. The study of the type had been conceptualised through the categories of that intimacy, like ‘individual perception’, ‘select collectiveness’, ‘hierarchal collectiveness’, ‘ideological collectiveness’ and ‘ultimate collectiveness’. Ironically, these degrees of intimacy demonstrate private-public issues, hierarchy, complex relations of genders and many other layers of myths through the most unvarnished state, the state of nakedness.","Bannik; Banya; Saint Petersburg","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Architecture and The Built Environment","Berlage Institute","","The Berlage Master of Science","","59.9500, 30.3000"

(mentor)","2016","Adhesion is a difficult, but important phenomenon which needs to be addressed in the field of pavement engineering. A strong adhesion between the constituents of pavement and between the layers of the pavement is an indication of its durability. Many modern materials like rubber, fibre, epoxy binder, adhesion promoter etc., are used as a replacement or addition to the conventional bitumen and aggregate materials in pavement construction. The introduction of these materials thus require a better understanding of their adhesive properties, which influences to a great extent, the pavement performance. Since there are no standard tests available to quantify adhesion in pavement engineering, the study aims at developing a framework of easily implementable test procedure that can be used for the assessment of the adhesive bond between the different materials used in pavement construction. This was achieved by performing direct tension test on different types of aggregate-binder systems. As the presence of moisture is a known factor that affects adhesion, in turn affecting performance of the pavement, the study also concentrated towards this aspect. Three types of aggregates (porphyry, diorite and sandstone), in combination with four different binders (bitumen pen70/100, SBS polymer modified bitumen, polyurethane based binder and epoxy based binder) and two adhesion promoters (Type a and b, with variation in curing time) were tested in this study. They were subjected to low and high temperature and strain rates and the effect of moisture on these materials were also investigated. It was found from this study that the direct tension test was easily implementable, which could help the contractors and researchers in quantifying the adhesion between the various aggregate-binder systems.","adhesion; adhesion promoter; binder-aggregate interaction","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Structural Engineering","","Road and Railroad Engineering","",""

(mentor)","2016","From the Medieval Walled City model to the contemporary Grid City model, the anthropocene CITY has evolved as a new species to a stage that surpasses humanity. Its main goal is efficiency and prosperity of the city itself instead of individual human aspirations. At this moment the city has repressed individual by collective goals, it is no longer under humanity’s control. On the contrary, the CITY controls humans. Guangzhou and Foshan, two typical Chinese cities, are at this moment in a process of merging into one mega-conurbation. During this process, there is a brief moment in which a new development model can emerge. The land between these two cities has urbanized to a state “beyond-village” and is turning into a contemporary city. All the necessary ingredients are there - nature,housing, infrastructure, industry, agriculture, commerce- constantly changing in balance. Before the city’s grid reaches this in-between land, there is no dominant form in the whole area. It is a spontaneous and unconscious mutation giving strong diversity to this land. The project frames this fleeting condition in a canvas, and develops this phenomenon of spontaneous mutation into a new city model based on programmatic mutability. This is the model for the Millennial City. In order to subvert the contemporary grid city model, the Millennial City model brings back humanity as leading force of city development. The mutations are enlargements or radiations of perceivable essence within the original sites, stretching in such a way that is not possible to be erased by the city grid. Programmatic mutability is embedded in the canvas as the medium of the project as well as the project itself. From blank to filled, every step is materialized. As the real city is built, building to building; the Millennial City on canvas is drawn inch by inch. Meanwhile It can be covered and modified constantly as in reality. There is not one single drawing that will represent a final vision of this city. The project is the mutations of the canvas and the programmatic mutability that guides them. In front of the canvas, the draftsman of the Millennial City is one of the Millennials who live in the city. From its point of view, a city should begin from a micro scale in the same way the city is drawn... spreading from one single building instead of a top-down projection.

(mentor); Labeur, R.J. (mentor); Moller, M. (mentor); Van den Bos, J. (mentor)","2016","Hybrid particle-mesh methods attempt to combine the advantages of Eulerian and Lagrangian methods: Lagrangian particles are used for the advection, whereas a Eulerian background grid is used for computing the particle interactions. Such a hybrid approach is expected to have several benefits when simulating flows involving free surfaces or material interfaces: the particles can be efficiently used to track the free surface, while the background grid can be used to solve the governing Navier-Stokes equations and impose the incompressibility constraint in a convenient manner. The prospects of these hybrid particle-mesh methods for simulating incompressible fluid flows involving a free surface are assessed in this thesis. More specifically, the feasibility of setting-up a numerical wave flume using hybrid particle-mesh methods is investigated. Four main steps are common to all hybrid particle-mesh methods: particle-to-grid mapping, solving the equations at the background grid, grid-to-particle mapping and particle advection. Due to the large variety of possible model options, it is impossible to speak of the hybrid particle-mesh method. Main difference between the various approaches is how the particle-grid interaction is incorporated. Depending on the specific implementation, the hybrid particle-mesh methods can be either regarded to be a Eulerian method augmented with Lagrangian particles, or a Lagrangian method in which the Eulerian background grid only serves as a useful tool for solving the governing equations. A specific implementation of the four main steps comprising the hybrid particle-mesh methods is presented, assigning relatively much importance to the background grid. The particle-to-grid mapping is presented in terms of a weighted least square mapping. In the specific implementation of this least square mapping, the grid nodes are considered to be sample points of the continuum. Following this strategy, an optimal quadrature rule can be used for numerical integration of the variational form arising from the finite element discretization of the governing equations at the background grid. The specific implementation of advecting the particles in the grid velocity field, combined with the employed, admissible P0P1-element, called for an additional mapping of the (divergence free) velocities to a (non-divergence free) continuous velocity field, a step which can at best be regarded to be an engineering solution. Assessing different advection schemes revealed the higher order scheme (RK3) to be an economical choice for doing the particle advection. Various test cases were run, both for single-phase and two-phase problems, showing the advantages and the disadvantages of the developed model. The results obtained for the single-phase problems are in good agreement with analytical results or results obtained with established numerical methods. Employing an admissible element, pathological locking was effectively avoided in the method. Despite these good results, there is clearly some numerical diffusion present in the system. A more fundamental issue was encountered for the advection dominated lid driven cavity test, where the incompressibility constraint is clearly violated at particle level. As a result, unphysical gaps in the particle distribution are observed. In general, the model results obtained for the two-phase benchmarks are again in good agreement with analytical or experimental results. With an additional mapping of the pressure gradient term, the sharp interface between materials (air-water) is well-maintained over time by the particles, although a residual particle oscillation was observed around the interface. Distinct advantage of the hybrid particle-mesh method is the implementation of kinematic boundary conditions. Since the mesh can be redefined every timestep without additional interpolation steps, the method can deal with large boundary displacements as shown for a solitary wave generated with a moving boundary. Finally, using the hybrid particle-mesh formulation, interfaces of complex topological shape are conveniently tracked by the particles. As such, the method was shown to be able so simulate a breaking wave on a submerged bar up to and including wave breaking. Based on the thesis, it can be concluded that hybrid particle-mesh methods appear to be an attractive tool for simulating free surface flows and simulating the nearshore propagation of waves. Nevertheless, many fundamental questions remain unanswered when considering hybrid methods. It is to be remarked that all these questions can be basically reduced to the question how to interpret the interaction between particles and grid. Future work should therefore primarily focus on this issue.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","Environmental Fluid Dynamics","",""

NETICS has introduced a sustainable and commercially very attractive alternative called the GEOWALL. The goal of this study is to find a viable field of application within the quay structures by considering the arising challenges of a larger scale wall. Additionally several potential design improvements are described to cope with the challenges. The GEOWALL could fail due to sliding, overturning, exceeding internal stresses, large deformations, vertical instability, overall instability and piping. The safety of the structure will be assessed with predefined general factors of safety and permissible internal stresses, these are the test values. The safety for sliding, overturning, large deformations, vertical stability and piping is calculated with an analytical method. The safety for overall stability, internal strength and large deformations is calculated with a finite element method. There are two main variables in the analyses: the retaining height and the type of soil. The retaining height varies between one and five metres. The soils are simplified to sand, clay and peat. From the results of the analytical analysis and the finite element analysis it can be concluded that sand-GEOWALLs on sand between one and three metres and clay-GEOWALLs on clay between one and three metres are the most viable scenarios for a larger scale GEOWALL with current design. For GEOWALL quay walls larger than three metres and peat-GEOWALLs on peat suitable design improvements are required to meet the stringent safety requirements. The design improvements should be able to limit the possibility of failure due to sliding, overturning and failure trough large deformations. There are three categories of potential improvements: material improvements, geometrical design improvements and structural design improvements. The embedded wall is expected to be the most promising geometrical design improvement. Adding a drainage system is expected to be the most promising structural design improvement at this moment. It is recommended to study the effects and efficiency of the proposed design improvements in future research. It is also recommended for NETICS to continue their research on the strength and resistance of different GEOWALL types and on the influence of every possible load. In case of a GEOWALL design for a specific location it is recommended to determine the safety factors for that specific location and to check the analytical results with more advanced modelling programmes. Lastly it is recommended to consider not only the technical aspects, but also the practical and commercial aspects if one is investigating the design improvements.","GEOWALL; Quay wall; bank structure; embankment; revetment; sustainable; NETICS; TNO; GEOBLOCK; beschoeiing; oever constructie; damwand","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","","",""

(mentor)","2016","Falling is one of the major causes of unintentional death or injury worldwide. People older than 65 years and people suffering from neurological disease have a higher chance of falling, which indicates the involvement of higher brain structures such as the cortex. For this reason, cortical activity underlying balance control has been subject of research using mobile neuroimaging methods during balance tasks. Often, the focus is on the moment balance is lost and a compensatory action is made. In this study, differences between two different strategies are investigated. Healthy, young participants receive balance perturbations by backward translation of a platform on which they stand, while recording high-density electroencephalography (EEG) to study task-related brain activity. EEG is the recording of changes of electric potential related to brain activity. Participants receive two instructions; in the first condition, they are instructed to respond naturally, which means they take a step. In the second condition, participants should try to inhibit their step. It is hypothesised that the second condition will reflect neural responses with a higher magnitude, because it is more difficult to respond by step inhibition. The dynamic nature of the task introduces a muscular and motion artefacts to which the EEG is sensitive. A blind-source separation algorithm (independent component analysis) in combination with an automatic outlier rejection algorithm is used to separate artefacts from neural sources. The obtained neural sources are divided into clusters based on their location on the scalp, dipole representation, power spectrum and timecourse. The resulting clusters represent the motor cortex (legs, left and right hand area), the prefrontal cortex, and the temporal-occipital areas for the left and right hemisphere. Analysis in time-domain shows a negative peak in the timecourse directly after the perturbation. In previous research, this peak has been related to error detection, which in this experiment is the loss of balance. In time-frequency domain, at the motor cortex, phase synchronisation is found at 5-25 Hz, followed by phase desynchronisation in the 8-15 Hz and 20-30 Hz frequency range. This is also in accordance with previous literature. However, there was no significant difference between the two conditions. The hypothesis is therefore rejected, at this point. One explanation to this result may be the small dataset used for this experiment. During preprocessing, up to 65% of data was rejected for some participants. An increase in the number of trials and the duration of delays in between trials, may improve the quality of the dataset such that the hypothesis can be reconsidered. Nonetheless, the correspondence in results with previous research already indicate that the motion platform is suitable for EEG experiments.","EEG; balance; perturbation; ICA; step inhibition","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","BioMechanical Engineering","","Biomedical Engineering","",""

(mentor); Gunes, Y.B. (mentor)","2016","The natural frequency of wind turbine towers can be more than 10% off from the designed frequency. This frequency is important for control because it sets bandwidth limits to some of the control loops. Improving the model will result in better control and load reduction that will in turn contribute to the decrease of the cost of wind energy. The main focus of this project is on uncertainty quantification. Finding more accurate uncertainty quantification techniques will help determining the accuracy of models. Currently, the accuracy of the models is described based on asymptotic statistics theory. However, asymptotic uncertainty descriptions exhibit some problems. Variance results are not reliable for small numbers of measurement samples. Moreover, the true values of the parameters are present in the asymptotic variance expressions. As a result, the uncertainty of the model is often approximately quantified or unknown. When the uncertainty of the model is not known or approximately quantified the controllers have to be designed with conservative margins. Therefore, obtaining more reliable uncertainty descriptions will enable the use of less conservative margins, and thus more aggressive controllers. For this purpose, the bootstrap technique for accuracy quantification of model estimates is proposed. Additionally, Operational Modal Analysis (OMA) is used to obtain an estimate of the natural frequency of the tower. With OMA a model of a system is identified based on the output data collected when the system is in operating conditions. The use of OMA eliminates the need to artificially excite the wind turbine tower by using artificial exciters. Another advantage of OMA over system identification approaches is that the input signal to the system is not measured and only the output vibration response of the tower is measured. In this project, the system identification method optimized Predictor Based System Identification (PBSIDopt) was adapted to work with output only data. The identification procedure was tested on a simulation example and the results showed that the proposed identification based on ambient excitation was effective. Asymptotic variance expressions for the uncertainty of the natural frequencies and damping ratios have been derived for the OMA-PBSIDopt. The uncertainty of the natural frequency and damping ratio of the identified system model has been quantified using both the asymptotic statistics and bootstrap techniques and a comparison of the results is made. It is shown that the bootstrap method outperforms the asymptotic variance approach in the sense that the bootstrap estimates of the accuracy are less sensitive to the number of measurements samples. In addition to that, unlike the asymptotic variance technique the bootstrap method is straightforward to apply.","uncertainty quantification; OMA; identification","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Delft Center for Systems and Control","","Systems and Control","",""

The first step consists of large-scale misalignment correction while also establishing the match between FF-OCT and one of the several histology tissue samples based on iterative closest point of prominent edge points. The second step starts with an area-based affine registration algorithm and culminates with a Deep Flow based registration algorithm. To facilitate the use of optical-flow based algorithm for inter-modality registration, mutual transform based modality transformation has been used here. Traditionally used mutual transform does not preserve the edges well. Since edges are an important component of the objective function used for minimization, this affects the accuracy of the registration algorithm. To address this problem, an edge-preserving mutual transform has been introduced in this work. This newly proposed variant of mutual transform as well as the use of Deep Flow algorithm for registration is seen to improve the accuracy significantly.","Medical Image Processing; Image Registration","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Computer Science","","Media and Knowledge Engineering","",""

(mentor)","2016","In The Netherlands concrete as a building material doesn’t have a positive image. This is partly because of the fact that vocational education in concrete has disappeared from Holland. There is therefore little craftsmanship in concrete available. By building a vocational school for concrete, an institute for the making of concrete, craftsmanship in concrete can be brought into the Dutch building industry. Hopefully guaranteeing aesthetic concrete a fruitful future in The Netherlands. By designing a public school in the city centre of Breda, the craftsmanship that is taught to the students becomes visible to the passer-by. Some of the machine- and workshop rooms are located directly next to the street and connected with this street by a public colonnade. People walking through the busy city centre will in this way be confronted with a world of concrete that is unknown for them. Concrete can be divided in two types, depending on the way it is made, namely in-situ and precast concrete. In this design both types of concrete are used. The two entrances, with organic stairways, to both buildings are indicated by the use of in-situ concrete. This is where the student and visitor enter the building and directly feel the presence of the demolished formwork. The concrete shows the relics of its making process and with this evokes a curiosity about the material. To give way to making these big and expensive in-situ parts of the building, the rest of the building is designed in less expensive factory made precast sandwich elements, partly with a terrazzo finish. These elements consist of a load-bearing inner leaf, an insulation layer and an concrete/terrazzo outer leaf. Taking into account many practical and technical issues, like maximum transport measures and weight, a system of elements is designed. Because part of the reason to build this school is to enhance the image of concrete, some parts of the outer leaf are polished. These parts show the different types of natural stone used inside of the concrete, and give the building a shiny and exclusive appearance. Exactly the appearance that doesn’t come into mind when one thinks of concrete.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Architecture and The Built Environment","Architecture","","","",""

(mentor); Rozendaal, M.C. (mentor)","2016","Beagle; ‘a stimulating quest throughout the hospital’ is a project that focuses on improving the quality of life and the development (physical, emotional and social) of hospitalised adolescents with CF within the Wilhelmina Children’s Hospital. This graduation project is positioned within the Meedoen=groeien! project of the Dutch Rehabilitation Fund, Princess Maxima Centre for Paediatric Oncology, and Delft University of technology. In general, the aim of this graduation project is to improve the quality of patient care by creating healthcare innovations and developing scientific knowledge in which design and technology play a central role. Cystic Fibrosis is an inherited chronic disease that causes slime to thicken. Various organs that use slime (such as the lungs and digestive system) are hindered and not able to function properly resulting in several complications. People with CF are often shorter of breath and quickly exhausted. The ‘Child Development and Exercise Centre’ of the Wilhelmina Children’s Hospital in Utrecht guides and aids the CF patient by providing physiotherapy. ‘CF patients are encouraged to engage in exercise programs’ (van Leeuwen; 2013). Having a proper physical fitness is of great importance in order to benefit from a better (physically and mentally) and longer life. CF patients are less able to remove filth (e.g. dust and bacteria) from their lungs as a result of the though slime (which cannot be coughed up effortlessly). This makes them vulnerable for infections. In case of an (severe) infection, patients need to be hospitalized. Inside the hospital special rules apply to prevent the patient from encountering new infections or transmitting their bacteria to other CF patients via cross infection. The patient is bound to his or her room (contact isolation) for a hospitalization that could take up to 3 weeks, depending on ones treatment. He or she is prohibited to leave the room, except during so called ‘stapuren’ (step hours) two times a day or when the patient wants (and is allowed) to go outside the hospital under guidance of a parent or health care worker. The segregation policy is not perceived as fun by the patients (next to the hospitalization itself); they are bound their room and there is not much to do. CF patients spend most of the time sitting on their bed passively. Physiotherapists would like to improve this situation by, for instance, activating patients in their room or to offer them the ability to exercise together (observe the segregation regulations). (figure I). The sooner the patients’ physical condition improves, the quicker he or she might feel better (physically and mentally) and hopefully is able to return home sooner (depending on other medical treatment as well). Any activity additional to the patients’ current activity level is welcome (favourably, the more active, the better). However ‘Physiotherapy is often experienced as tedious and time consuming amongst CF adolescents and its direct effect is not recognized’ (Pfeffer et al., 2003) Furthermore, out of the user research and meetings with pedagogical staff members appeared that there seemed to be no specific need for peer contact. Nonetheless participants like to do things together with familiar people (e.g. friends or family) or in some cases with unfamiliar people (e.g. other non-CF patients). Also, there is no possibility yet that enables and allows CF patients to (physically) be together safely inside the hospital. Hence the design goal comes into being: ‘Design a product service system that invites hospitalized adolescents (12-16) with Cystic Fybrosis to activate together while being (physically) segregated from each other.' Patients need to be motivated to become physically active. It was envisioned that the design should be an activity which is fun to do and by doing so, would activate the adolescent (without experiencing it as an obligation). It should also remain fun for a longer period. “ The design should ‘invite’ and ‘captivate’ adolescents to become active.” Various factors influence the motivation and ability of CF adolescents to become active. The segregation policy was perceived as an environmental factor that largely limited the freedom and activation space of CF patients. ‘What if the rules of the segregation policy could still be guaranteed but that patients are free to walk through the hospital?’ This challenge lead to the realization of two concepts that dared this policy (pushing its boundaries) in order to offer the patients more freedom, but still at a safe distance from each other with the necessary hygienic precautions. However during verification meetings with medical specialists became apparent that; the policy is strict and people are hazardous for the risk, resulting in that none of the two concepts were allowed to enable CF patients to exercise together in this form. The feedback resulted in a delimited scope and revised vision. The physical activity should take place after one another in the step hours or together with hospitalized non-CF patients. It should preferably be a small object that changes the hospital context into an enriched environment. Beagle is the result of the final design phase. It is a stimulating quest throughout the hospital. Beagle consists out of several Bluetooth beacons; ‘Beagles’ that are spread throughout the hospital. Hospitalized adolescents are able to install an app on their own smartphone after which they can search for the Beagles during their step hours. Once a Beagle is found, the finder can decide what to do with it. Leave it there, hide it on another spot, take it to their own room, put it at a fun place, do something sweet for the next finder etcetera. It is up to them. The design was tested with four young adolescents (11-12) and one older CF adolescent (16). In general can be said that on the short term all participants enjoyed the first time usage of Beagle wherein the young adolescents were motivated to search for Beagles and were thereby motivated to become active. The Older CF adolescent however would like to have a bit more of a challenge. Beagle transformed the participants’ view of the hospital; they were scanning the environment for Beagles or possible hiding places, observing and using the environment differently than they would do normally. Most of the participants liked to do the quest together with their roommate or friend. The older CF participant, however, did not need to have contact with other peers per se. On the short term, the design goal and interaction vision were met for the younger adolescents, for the older (CF) adolescent however Beagle needs to have adjustment.","Physiotherapy; Cystic Fibrosis; Adolescents; Segregation policy; Exercise; Connecting; Motivating; Contextmapping; Medisign; Research through design; Contact isolation; Activating","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Department of Human Information and Communication Design","","Meedoen = Groeien","",""

The results showed that high rise envelopes can be used as energy production units by implementing energy production systems into existing façade systems. By doing so, modern buildings can produce over 30% of their total energy demand on-site. This will increase the global and national share of clean energy production, reduce negative environmental impacts of energy production and keep fossil fuels available for longer time periods. Changing policies and regulation along our own comfort standards can further increase the potential of energy production on high rise. However, high rise with a high window to wall ratio will have no future in the built environment, unless transparent energy production technology will see great efficiency improvement in the next few years.","high rise; zero energy; renewable energy; energy consumption","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Architecture and The Built Environment","Building Technology","","","",""

(mentor); Minnoye, A.L.M. (mentor)","2016","This project has been focused on developing a product for cyclists to improve their safety. Cyclists are the most vulnerable traffic participants and are the group of road users with the highest numbers of accidents. Most of these accidents are caused by contact with passenger cars/motorized vehicles. The Dutch rural areas are the most dangerous areas for cyclists and are therefore set as context. More research has been conducted into the influences, distractions and situations of these types of accidents between cyclists and drivers of motorized vehicles, in order to develop a specific problem definition. It has been proved that most of these accidents are caused in situations where motorized vehicles overtake the cyclist while these cyclists are being distracted. The major part of these distractions is caused by electronic devices or music. The overall research has shown that these types of accidents are a significant problem in the Netherlands, which shows great opportunities for designing a product for improvement. After setting a specific problem definition, more research as been done among cyclists in the Netherlands. This research shows that the secondary school pupils are the largest group of cyclists that use electronic devices while cycling, plus they represent the highest rate of traffic cycle accidents. Because most parents are aware of the fact that their children are more vulnerable on their bicycles, they are willing to spend money to improve the safety of their children. To obtain more information on the specific needs and wishes of the target group, research has been done among these secondary school pupils, using questionnaires. This provided valuable input for this project. Because electric and non-electric city bicycles showed great market opportunities, it was decided to design a product that fits both types of bicycles. The beneficial aspect of the electric bicycle is that power could be drained from the battery of the bicycle. This power option is left as future recommendation. Entrepreneurship During the entire process the design decisions are made by a combination of an industrial designers perspective and an entrepreneurial perspective. Research has been conducted on different patents, and market opportunities have continuously been checked, and a rough future plan is developed. The product After all research a list of requirements and wishes was created, which has been continuously updated during the process. Multiple rounds of ideation have resulted in three concepts that meet all the requirements. Three different selection methods were implemented in order to make the legitimate decision of the final concept. The final product consists out of two sub-products: a sensing part and a receiving part. The sensing part is able to sense approaching vehicles up to a distance of 18 meters due to the integrated ultrasonic sensor. Once an approaching vehicle is sensed, a message is sent towards the receiving part through the wireless radio frequency transmitting module. Subsequently, the other part is able to receive this message through the wireless radio frequency receiving module, decode it and transmit it into warning signals. These warning signals are small pulses of vibration, created by a vibration motor that is located on the handlebar. The interval between these pulses increases as the vehicle approaches, which notifies the user of the exact distance of the vehicle. Both parts are attached to the bicycle by a permanent, commonly used mounting system. The sensing part is located at the rear part of the bicycle, at the tube that leads from the center of the wheel towards the carrier rack. The receiving part is located at the handlebar. This part contains a vibration motor, which is (when installed correctly) pressed tightly against the handlebar in order to let the user feel a strong vibration as warning signal. The material of the components is flexible enough to bend around the frame, while it is subsequently also rigid enough for a good transmission of the vibration in the handlebar. Most components of the product have been fully tested, validated and optimized. The conducted tests were mainly focused on the functioning of the sensors and the transmitted vibration, the experience of using the product while cycling, and on the aesthetics. All extreme situations and conditions have been considered and most solutions are implemented into the design. Eventually this project has resulted into a validated product, with opportunities for a future entrepreneurship. More tests should be conducted and some aspects should be developed further before the product is ready for production. Recommendations for these aspects are shown next.","safety; cyclist; design","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Industrial Design","","Master of Science Integrated Product Design","",""

(mentor); Nase, I. (mentor)","2016","The sustainability of current healthcare systems is threatened by several societal and economic developments, including an aging population, an increase of unmet medical needs and rising healthcare costs. The consequence of these developments gave rise to new healthcare legislation. These new healthcare legislations force health care institutions to become financially responsible for the profits and risks of their real estate investment. In the Netherlands there are about 1,300 caring homes and some 340 nursing homes with a capacity of respectively 100,000 and 65,000 places. The standard elderly care institutions offer nursing care and residential care as well as homecare from various locations and also on location. These locations may either be owned by the health care institutions or be rented from housing associations or other private parties. A combination of owned and rented locations is also possible. Housing associations own more than 50,000 units of these caring homes. The nursing and caring capacity will diminish over the coming years, due to reform in the government policy that elderly people should live as long as possible independently, but also as a result of the growing need of this elderly people to live independently as long as possible. The vacancy risks for housing associations and health care institutions are increased due to a number of new healthcare legislations. First, of all from 2018 onwards, the health care institutions will bear the entire risk of vacancy. This is due to the gradual introduction of the so-called normative housing component (NHC). In contrast to the past, health care institutions will get fees which will be linked to the actual number of clients in the healthcare facility. No client, no fee. Because of this the health care institutions it is expected that they will have significantly lower incomes due to vacancy. Second, contrary to the former situation, the residential- and care component are now separately funded and financed. The client pays for his/her residence rent, whereas received care is separately paid for by the Health Insurance Act, Social Support Act (SSA), Exceptional Medical Expenses Act (EMEA) and possibly own resources. For caring homes (for example, caring homes with large common areas) the housing costs may be bring along higher costs than the rents of a room or apartment that the caring homes can ask. This makes renting these homes financially unprofitable. For health care institutions with elderly care real estate, it is important that both the services offered by them as well the real estate owned by them will be involved in decision making and is thus properly addressed in the underlying business model. This is important because in the past, caring homes were often an important source of the revenues, which was invested in the nursing homes. Health care institutions must also respond to the opportunities offered by the new playing field by better addressing the needs of their (future) clients. The aim of this research is to gain insight into how real estate can offer opportunities for business operation by developing Residential Care Concepts in conjunction with a real estate strategy as an input of their business model, to better deliver care and services to elderly.","healthcare real estate; residential care concepts; healthcare property; business model; healthcare institutions; real estate strategy","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Architecture and The Built Environment","Real Estate & Housing","","","",""

This does not mean that method, material and machine have to be reinvented entirely. By looking at existing techniques and combining them with new methods, it is possible to expand our understanding of these new technologies. Architecture as painting is a new method imagining an architecture in which a materialized atmosphere does not need to be subdued to constraints in production. The method is an interpretation of the existing 3D printing techniques and robotic manufacturing. Through intuitive experiments inspired by painting techniques I seek to accelerate and expand our knowledge of 3D printing methods for architectural purposes and elicit a reaction in the field of material science, programming and mechanical engineering, physics and chemistry. This research is an exploration of different painting techniques such as pointillist, impressionist, expressionist and action painting. When comparing 3D printing methods with painting, resemblance can be found on the level of material blending techniques, stroke and brush types, layering technique and bodily movements of the painter. Here the focus lies on the application of reusable plastics and exploiting the architectural potential of 3D printing. An advantage of this additive process is its architectural freedom. At the same time plastic materials enable modification of material properties through additives. The research proceeds from a hypothetical material. Determination of the material property requirements per building function give a preliminary indication of needed scientific development. At the same time the design visualizes what this new kind of architecture might entail and how it adds value to the architectural practice.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Architecture and The Built Environment","Architecture","","Explorelab","",""

(mentor)","2016","This report describes the process of designing the Globus, a smart shirt that measures that back posture will working out by measuring the stretch in the shirt and uses vibration to give feedback to the user when they have an incorrect posture. A questionnaire has been carried out for this project which showed that fitness is the most practiced sport. This is due to the fact that fitness can be practiced as both a primary and secondary sport. The most important factor within fitness is posture. Mistakes in posture decrease the effectiveness of the workout and can even cause injuries. Fitness related injuries are mainly located in the back and shoulders. Globus is focused on non-professional athletes from 18-49 years old that work out 1-2 times a week, with or without a training buddy. Observations in the gym showed that most mistakes that are made are related to the back. An arched back puts too much pressure on the lower back. This can be caused by not looking in the right direction. Looking down forces the spine in the wrong direction and makes you arch your back. This can cause muscle pain or even a hernia, because of damaged spinal discs. A natural curved back is considered to be between 165 and 195 degrees according to research performed for this project. Less than 165 degrees is a rounded back and more than 195 degrees is a sway back. A market analysis performed for this project showed that there are similar products that give feedback on back posture. Most of these products are connected to a smart device and use gentle vibrations as a way of feedback. Prices vary between 60-175. A questionnaire showed that people are willing to spend between 75-125 on a new smart shirt. Research of Mattmann & Tröster showed that placing stretch sensors in the back of a shirt can be used to distinct between several movements such as lifting shoulders, bending sideward and bending forward. This research was based on changes in resistance of the stretch sensors. A research performed for this project on resistive stretch sensors showed that they do not respond linear to stretch and have a maximum resistance at 25% of the 50% maximum stretch. Moist (sweat and water) have great influence on the sensor readings. Other concepts for stretch sensors are: conductive rubber, capacitive plates or inductive pattern. A comparison was made between these concepts, which showed that the capacitive plates have better washability due to the possibility to laminate the electrodes and it also has a linear response to stretch, which can be measured with ordinary electronics. The capacitive stretch sensor has two parallel moving fabric conductive electrodes. The overlapping area is a measure for the capacitance (as well as the distance between the electrodes). Test are carried out to determine the best location for the sensors in the back of the shirt to distinct between an exercise being carried out with a straight back or a rounded back. The stretch in back of the shirt was measured by drawing a matrix of dots and measuring the distance between these dots. The heat maps of the stretch of a rounded back and a straight back (per exercise) are subtracted from each other to see the optimal location for the sensors. This location is just below the ribs at approximately 60mm horizontally from the spine at both sides. A fully functional prototype was made for testing the performance of the product, which included a Bluetooth LE module, vibration motor, RGB LED and other electronics. The moves during the workout, therefore the device calibrates every time a measurement of back posture is started. Relative stretch is measured from this calibrated starting value. The prototype showed areas for improvement after testing with users, which has led to the final design of the Globus. Manufacturing, packaging and shipping costs are determined. A total investment of 350.000 is needed for a first batch of 10.000 products. The Globus will be sold in a bundle and separate (shirt and electronics). The bundle will be sold for 129, a separate shirt for 49 (independent of the size) and separate electronics for 99. The break-even point is at 3.000 sold bundles. A maximum profit of 718.800 can be achieved with the first batch. The company Under Armour is a desired partner for the Globus. They have brand awareness in the fitness market and already sell the shirts that are needed for the sensors of Globus. They recently announced three smart products for the sports market including a fitness tracker at the Consumer Electronics Show 2016 (CES). Under Armour can upgrade their shirts and compete in the rising smart sports market. Future partners could be outside the fitness world, such as companies that prevent RSI or support rehabilitation. Further development for the product could take place on maintaining a constant distance between the two electrodes of the sensor. The current sensor is influenced by pressure from the outside.

(mentor); Van der Scheer, P. (mentor); Vos, R. (mentor); Verlaan, J.G. (mentor); Dupuits, E.J.C. (mentor)","2016","The Hollandsche IJssel is a river between Rotterdam and Gouda and is protected from the main river system in the Netherlands by a storm surge barrier. The Hollandsche IJssel experiences several problems: the storm surge barrier dates from 1958 and has a relatively low closure reliability; three quarters of the dikes have been rejected according to the safety standards due to macrostabilty; subsidence of the dikes is approximately 90cm per century; there is limited space available to reinforce the dikes because of the dense housing next to the dikes. To determine the current flood probability and risk, the use of fragility curves is applied. They represent the state of the dikes and can be combined with a probability density function of water levels, which represents the state of the storm surge barrier. This will return the flood probability. By combining them with damage curves, the flood risk can be assessed. To determine cost-optimal flood risk reduction strategies, the use of equivalent annual cost is applied. The equivalent annual cost is defined as the net present value of a project devided by the present value of annuity. It can be seen as an interest weighted average annual cash flow. By keeping the equivalent annual cost as continuously as low as possible, flood risk reduction strategies can be determined which after manual post-processing proved to be cost-optimal. This proved to result in three strategies for the Hollandsche IJssel: the dike reinforcement strategy, the double barrier strategy and the canalization strategy. The dike reinforcement strategy gradually reinforces the dikes and keeps the current storm surge barrier until no longer possible after which it is replaced by a similar one (likely around 2060). The double barrier strategy suggests the construction of a second storm surge barrier to increase closure reliability. This leads to a postponement of dike reinforcements, which are still required due to subsidence. Eventually, because of the limited amount of space that is available due to the dense housing: both lead to inevitability of canalization somewhere after 2100 (with the used schematization around 2120). Because of this inevitability, the recommended strategy is the third strategy: implement canalization immediately.","flood risk; Hollandsche IJssel; proven strength; fragility curves; equivalent annual cost; risk analysis; macrostability; financial engineering; storm surge barrier","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","Hydraulic Structures & Flood Risk","","51.916941, 4.579210"

(mentor); Simons, D.G. (mentor)","2016","The amount of air traffic is increasing and cities become more and more populated. Since airports tend to be located close to or inside cities, an increasing amount of people suffer from aircraft noise pollution. More silent aircraft are needed to be able to reduce this noise pollution. One way to do this is through blocking the engine noise propagation with elements of the aircraft itself such as the wings. This method is called aircraft engine noise shielding To be able to shield the aircraft engine noise efficiently, a noise shielding assessment tool is required. In this thesis project, such a tool is developed for conventional tube with wing aircraft. This tool needs to have low computational cost while the accuracy should be sufficient for the preliminary design. To create a fast and accurate noise prediction tool, the aircraft's fuselage is modelled as a cylinder and the wings as planar surfaces. The engine is represented by a monopole sound source. The most suitable noise shielding calculation methods are found to be the barrier shielding method for the wings and the analytic solution of a cylinder for the fuselage. The noise shielding assessment tool is validated against results obtained with the Kirchhoff theory of diffraction. The noise shielding prediction tool developed in this thesis project has shown to be able to determine the noise attenuation by a point source of different aircraft configurations with low computational cost. The addition of the analytic results of the cylinder to the barrier shielding method has increased the accuracy by including the creeping rays.

(mentor); Hao, C. (mentor); Tiessen, F. (mentor)","2016","In this master thesis project, a customer journey map which demonstrates the current and ideal future data tracking sport headset using experience of the potential target Chinese user group was designed. A series of opportunities and recommendations for different stages of the using phases regarding to certain focused design directions were demonstrated for the future experience through user and context research. The project was proposed by JABRA, which is a leading innovative manufacturer for heart rate tracking sport headsets. The aim of the project is to help JABRA understand the experience of their potential Chinese target user group over the using journey and to propose promising future development and design possibilities for the company. In order to get the general idea of the data tracking sport headset using in China, a desk research was conducted from different aspects including the western and Chinese data tracking sport headset market, the general exercise and sport headset using context in China, and Jabra’s target western user group. It was mainly found that there was quite low experience with high-end sport headsets with heart rate tracking function among Chinese exercisers. According to the research into the Jabra’s western target users, several research focuses were formulated for the Chinese user research, which are the Chinese users’ motivation and goals for their exercise, the value of data tracking function for Chinese exercisers, Chinese users’ exercise and data tracking routines and their positive and negative sport headset using experience. A user research, where the methods of context mapping were applied, uncovered insights from different types of users, as well as the current context of sport headset using in China. 5 different personas were created based on different types of exercise and headset using characteristics. The insights revealed that users with stronger motivation, intensity and frequency of exercise would have more motivation to use the heart rate tracking sport headset. Therefore, 3 types of users from the personas who sport for “energizing life”, “better performance” and “challenging and social” were selected as the potential Chinese target users. The potential Chinese target users were compared with the western target users. It was found that there was less divergence among the Chinese users than the western users, and similarities were found between the three selected types of Chinese users with the one type among the western users, the “Balance seeker”. Furthermore, the current positive and negative experience of the potential Chinese users was mapped out on the customer journey. The needs of the user were discovered and from which aspects, “motivate and encourage”, “professional guide”, “social interactions”, “knowledge”, “personalized” and “smart”, were selected to focus in the further study. Further study was conducted with the potential target users in order to explore their ideal future experience and to discover promising opportunities. A context mapping study was designed to combine with a co-creation session, which aimed at inviting the target users to dream about the future using scenarios and to generate promising ideas. The main findings revealed by the study are: - Users got motivated and encouraged largely by increasing social interactions through their online network. - Personalized experience are mainly regarding to exercise advices and music. - Users expect professional guide in a personalized way. - ‘Smarter’ experience means smooth in connection, control and seamless data transferring. - Knowledge regarding to exercise data tracking, effective exercise methods, correct running posture and injury prevalence are mostly wanted in different stages of exercise. Based on these conclusions, opportunities were mapped regarding to 4 aspects, which are “How to encourage and motivate Chinese users in their exercise”, “How to provide Chinese users a more personalized experience in their exercise”, “How to improve the experience by providing supportive knowledge in Chinese users’ experience” and “How to provide Chinese user a smoother experience in their exercise”. Afterwards, future ideas that inspired from the input of the co-creation session were generated from the opportunities. A future using scenario integrates the ideas were created. After the initial evaluation and iteration, a customer journey map integrated the different parts including the introduction of the potential target user group, the as-is user experience, future opportunities, future ideas and using scenarios was created. The map was evaluated with people from Jabra including designers, product managers, and insight analysts. An evaluation session was conducted including a presentation, a creative session and a discussion regarding to a list of requirements of the map. The creative session was aimed to evaluate whether the customer journey map was inspiring and rich enough for designers to generate new design directions and ideas. Positive feedback was given regarding to the requirements in general. Suggestions were given that part of the map could be presented in alternative or multiple forms in order to meet various needs for different users. Besides, there is the need of some additional elaboration to highlight the some conclusions that is helpful for reader to use the map in communication and creative activities. Based on the evaluation feedback, adjustments and further recommendations were given at the end of this report, together with the conclusion.","data tracking; sport headset; customer journey map; contextmapping research","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","2017-01-28","Industrial Design Engineering","Industrial Design","","","",""

If architecture can be transformed according to this changing flow of knowledge buildings do not have to be destroyed as the building itself has become intelligent. The question is how to reach such a new state of intelligent architecture. Is it possible to create an architecture that is able to intelligently adapt according to complex systems and how can these systems be implemented to create self-organizing and transformative physical spatial bodies? The method chosen is one of static building elements that can be added, reconfigured or removed depending on the needs in time. Because it’s on water and these elements are essentially boats, the project can change according to changing needs. The initial configuration has been decided upon using an agent simulation based on a system of rules based on relations, sun and contextual limitations. Followed up by this is the minimal detour simulation that optimize routes between external points and different agents. The urban form is informed by flow lines inspired by computational fluid dynamics, function requirements, structural optimization and solar radiation, resulting in a design with large diversification in porosity based on different opening functions and the before-mentioned information. The building itself is also designed to be self sufficient and generates its own energy with translucent DSC panels and filtered water using a reverse osmosis filter. The structure consists of a concrete base until ground level and continues using robotically milled EPS components with laminated glass fiber reinforcement.","Hyperbody; Rotterdam; Merwe-Vierhavens; Marconi; parametric; computational; floating; agent; fluid; dynamics; robotics","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Architecture and The Built Environment","Architecture","","Hyperbody","","51.906700, 4.417394"

The performance of DALES was compared with that of the large-scale weather model RACMO. A method was developed which can consistently initialise the model by assimilation of observations in addition to large-scale weather model results. This method was then applied to four days in winter on which stratocumulus occurred. The results were analysed with the use of the liquid water path (LWP) budget analysis, which analyses the contributions of the relevant processes to the LWP tendency. A sensitivity study was then conducted, which investigated the effects of uncertainties in the initialisation of the model by applying variations to the initialisation parameters that effect the LWP tendency. DALES outperformed RACMO in predicting stratocumulus occurrence. The model results also showed to be robust to the applied variations, i.e. the stratocumulus did not rapidly dissolve. These variations can have a great effect on the LWP, however. A model like DALES has a spin up time in which the fields grow from having small turbulent motions to being fully turbulent. Therefore a method was developed to initialise DALES with fully turbulent motions. The method was then applied to the Cold Air Outbreak case of January 31 2010. The results showed that initialising DALES in this way is successful, and that large scale structures were present at initialisation.","DALES; stratocumulus; forecasts; LES; modelling","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Geoscience and Remote Sensing","","","",""

(mentor); Fernandes, A. (mentor)","2016","Leaders of European union and G8 have set the target of 80% reduction in greenhouse gases emissions by 2050 by decarbonizing the power and transport sector. There are several pathways to achieve this, some of them being a) use of renewable power and biomass b) improvement in transport and building energy efficiency and c) replacement of fossil based fuel with sustainable fuel. This thesis is focussed on some of the measures which can be taken by Air Transportation Industry to reduce GHG emissions and carbon footprint. Although, there are many ways in which air transport industry can achieve this goal, this work mainly discusses a) increase in power generation efficiency of aircraft systems b) use of sustainable fuels for aircrafts and c) some ways for sustainable fuel production for aircrafts in an efficient and economic way. However, it is only starting point for discussion and can be further extended to include more efficient and cheaper technologies with reduced carbon foot-print. In this study, use of bi-directional Solid-Oxide Cells (SOC) as auxiliary power unit (APU) on-board commercial aircraft is explored. These bi-directional SOC APU units can be used in the airport energy network either to produce cleaner energy or to produce sustainable fuels depending on the energy demand. This work focusses on use of these bi-directional SOCs as fuel cells during flight operations and as electrolysers to produce sustainable fuel at the airport when the aircrafts are parked. Hence, complete fuel production plant is designed to be situated at the airport. The scope of this thesis is limited to production of fuel for aircraft APU use only. Further extension of this project can include use of these bi-directional SOCs for providing electricity to the airport and fuel for other purposes. For analysis, medium range aircrafts like A320 and B737 are considered. This system is designed and dimensioned for producing 500KW of electric power on-board aircarft. Jet fuel and ammonia are considered as fuel options for Solid Oxide Fuel Cell-Gas Turbine (SOFC-GT) based APU. Small scale airports like Eindhoven are studied to understand the flight frequency and parking duration for the aircrafts. These bi-directional SOCs are operational as Solid Oxide Electrolyzer Cell (SOEC) only when the aircraft is parked. Co-electrolysis is performed to produce syngas and steam electrolysis is done to produce hydrogen at the airport. Jet fuel is synthesized from syngas through Fischer Tropsch process and ammonia is synthesized from H2 and N2 through Haber Bosch process. Fuel synthesis plants are also designed as part of stationary fuel production plant at the airport. The fact that electrolyzer operates on excess available renewable electricity only, needs a special mention here. Intermittent nature of excess renewable electricity requires implementation of another source of sustainable syngas for fuel production so that sufficient capacity to supply all demand is ensured and robustness against delivery risks is achieved. Biomass gasification is one other method for generating fossil-free fuel. It uses biomass (birch wood) to produce syngas for sustainable fuel production at the aiport alongwith electrolysers. This leads to three cases of fuel production: - Case-1: Gasifier+fuel synthesis - Case-2: SOEC+fuel synthesis - Case-3: Gasifier+SOEC+Fuel synthesis ASPEN PLUS is used for modelling SOFC and stationary fuel production plant models with both jet fuel and ammonia. Modelling procedure for all the models is explained in detail with input parameters and process conditions. Thermodynamic analysis is carried out to compare the exergy efficiency of jet fuel and ammonia based SOFC-GT systems. It is observed that both jet fuel and ammonia based SOFC-GT systems give 62% and 58% exergy efficiency respectively which is higher than the conventional APU systems. Similarly, section by section exergy analysis is carried out for jet fuel and ammonia production plants to understand the exergy destructing processes. Comparison is made between exergy efficiency of jet fuel and ammonia production plants at the airport to understand thermodynamic behavior of both. Jet fuel synthesis produces significant amount of hydrogen and gasoline alongwith jet fuel as product. Therefore, two scenarios are analysed for exergy comparisons. a) Ammonia and jet fuel considered as product: Ammonia shows higher exergy efficiency than jet fuel production for all three cases enumerated above. b) Ammonia and (jet fuel, gasoline, hydrogen) are considered as useful products: For case-1 and case-3, jet fuel plant is exergetically more favorable than ammonia plant.

(mentor); Van Oel, C. (mentor)","2016","In the past decennium, parking received growing attention within real estate as a niche market for real estate investors. Since car park investments outperformed other types of real estate in the period 2008-2013, it is supposed to be the ideal investment within real estate due to its stable and secured cash flows with long-term leases. Investors base their decision making on performances, characteristics and market developments of the car parks. One of the least transparent, yet important, indicators for investors are occupancy rates. In recent years, occupancy rates of European car parks are assumed by the market to decrease whilst turnover of car parks increased. On top of that, parking tariffs have been increasing for several years. However, literature states parking to have a very low price elasticity. Therefore, the assumed decrease in occupancy rates by these the market might not have been influenced by the recent tariff increases. Nonetheless, the occupancy decrease is a clear trend that might become unsustainable in the long run. Therefore this study aims at identifying influential factors for occupancy rates for European car parks in the period 2015-2025. Paid parking in publicly accessible car parks located in Western Europe and especially in The Netherlands has been studied. Approximately 28.000 off-street parking places have been the basis for this, of which 12.000 parking places are located in The Netherlands, which is about 6.00% of the total parking supply. For the European Union, the sample size is approximately 0.14%. The car parks are analyzed to find current influential factors on occupancy rates. Additionally, eight experts with different roles in the market are interviewed to determine future influential factors.","car park investments; real estate; occupancy rates; regression modelling","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Architecture and The Built Environment","Management in the Built Environment","","Successful Corporate Real Estate (CRE) to support profitability and competitive advantage","",""

(mentor); Nadin, V. (mentor)","2016","Location for graduation project – Kaunas, Lithuania. Lithuania is one of the countries that have been for 50years a part of the communist bloc. 50 years of central planning and plan economy highly influenced the form of cities, the traditions of spatial planning and the habits of people to use space. After becoming independent, cities went through a complex period of transition from a communist ideology to a free market economy and neo-liberal ways of living. The problems in Lithuanian cities seem to be similar to those in the Western Europe (sprawl, commercialization, car oriented planning) but the context for these problems are very different. The clash of different ideologies can be clearly seen in the communist housing estates in Lithuania. Places do not get enough attention from local authorities and are victims of market led planning. Ironically, places that have been designed under socialist ideology provided affordable housing, social infrastructure and public spaces while new interventions in an independent country are increasing spatial and social fragmentation, allow big scale commercial developments to occupy parks and valuable public spaces, there are only few improvements of existing housing stock, residential areas are surrounded by wide roads with no street life. It is as if ‘the old enemy’ cared about local communities more than current system representing the free society. Research question: What needs to be changed in Local Governance & Spatial Planning in Lithuania in order to achieve sustainable development of cities? To answer this question, a design framework was created under a theme: “Policy by design”. One hand, this thesis is about proposing changes in the policy of planning and governance, on the other, design of a specific place within a chosen theme and scale become an instrument to understand the relationships between all three aspects of planning and identify, where the necessary changes have to be done first. With research, strategic guidelines and design proposals graduation thesis explores, where Lithuanian Spatial Planning policies and governance model went wrong and what are the aspects of it that can be used to get back on track and provide a sustainable future for citizens of Kaunas. In order to achieve sustainable development of cities in Lithuania, local governments have to take the role of guiding the urban development rather than controlling and restricting. First, by adapting a new way of planning that allows for addressing the local needs, is flexible but has restrictions safeguarding from initiatives that are not in the best interest of the public, and is inclusive. Development of the city is a shared responsibility, thus elderships have to gain power from municipality to be included in spatial planning activities, but at the same time, local authorities have to work a lot on capacity building for their personnel, NGO’s and community representatives to ensure an efficient dialogue based on understanding, transparency and informed decision making. Civil society would be strengthened by simply giving a chance to have a say in local decisions. Strong civil society demands for quality, transparency, equity. It redefines what is the public interest in city development is and has capabilities to defend it.","Post-war housing; Sustainable Urban Development; Post-socialist city; Local Governance; Spatial Planning System; Policy by design; Kaunas","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2016-01-28","Architecture and The Built Environment","Urbanism","","Design of the Urban Fabric & Spatial Planning and Strategy","",""

(mentor); Peters, R.Y. (mentor); Nourian, P. (mentor)","2016","Using Light Detection And Radar (LiDAR) large parts of the earth's geography can be captured an represented as a 3D pointcloud. The whole elevation dataset of the Netherlands (AHN2) is currently available and captured using this technique, it contains around 640 billion points. These massive dataset in its current form is well suited for visualisation and certain forms of analysis, as the 3D points are the outer boundary of objects. However, the Medial Axis Transform (MAT) is another way to represent these objects. As it represents the inner/outer skeleton of the objects some features become more easily detectable and it could be used as a tool in point cloud analysis. The MAT can be created from pointclouds using various methods, however the shrinking ball algorithm is used as it is relative simple to implement, more storage efficient and easier to parallellize compared to other methods. Yet the computation of it for a massive dataset such as the AHN2/3 is troublesome as it does not fit inside the main memory of the computer. This thesis focusses on how to scale the MAT so it can be computed for massive datasets using a main memory efficient approach. Two methods (i.e. tiling and streaming based algorithms) are proposed. They both subdivide the pointcloud dataset in to manageable subsets, so that the MAT can be computed on these smaller sets. However, the tiling approach relies heavily on temporal storage on the external memory (harddisk) by creating smaller tiles. whilst the streaming approach tries to manage it within the Main memory by scanning the input dataset multiple times and storing tiles in the main memory. This thesis concludes that using both methods it is possible to compute the MAT of a dataset which is larger than the main memory. The tiling approach seems suited as the temporal storage of the external memory is about the same size as the output data, further more the main memory usage can be regulated easily as the amount of tiles which will be processed at the same time can be chosen. The streaming approach shows potential to be efficient as well in computing the MAT. However, because streaming computations loads the input data sequentially and processes it using a limited memory buffer, outputting data and freeing memory space is needed. In this thesis a first step in finding a way to achieve that is made, however it is not functioning that well. As such the data outputting can not be as rapid as it should be when using streaming algorithms.","Medial Axis Transform; Point cloud","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Architecture and The Built Environment","OTB","","Geomatics","",""

(mentor)","2016","For failure in composite materials the fracture mechanisms at the microscopic scale, such as matrix cracking, fiber cracking, fiber-matrix debonding or combinations thereof determine the growth of crack at the macroscopic scale. The goal is to develop a simple failure criterion in terms of a bilinear Traction-Separation Law (TSL) for unidirectional Carbon-Fiber Reinforced Plastic (CFRP) that represents the crack nucleation and evolution at the macroscopic scale. The microscopic fracture mechanisms are incorporated by calibrating this bilinear TSL for arbitrary loading conditions and material properties. The calibration is performed by an extensive parametric study on 2D a Representative Volume Element (RVE) in ABAQUS. For the parametric study five load cases are studied: uni-axial extension (pure mode I), simple shear (pure mode II) and three mixed loading cases. Fracture is simulated inserting cohesive elements along the boundaries of all bulk elements. The effect of five variables was studied: interface cohesive strength, fiber cohesive strength, interface fracture energy, fiber fracture energy and fiber volume fraction. An average of four realizations, i.e. fiber distributions, resulted in an effective TSL that represents the fracture behavior of the RVE. The resulting effective TSL is approximated by a bilinear TSL that has three parameters: initial slope, cohesive strength (peak) and fracture energy (area). Using the results of the parametric study a correlation is performed for these three parameters. First, the mode I and II parameters are correlated using the results of the uni-axial extension and simple shear load case. Secondly, the three bilinear TSL parameters dependence on the mode mixity is correlated using one of the mixed loading cases. As a result of this procedure simple closed-form expressions are established that can determine the macroscopic fracture mechanism, in terms of a bilinear TSL, as a function of the microscopic properties.","fracture; multiscale; failure criterion; representative volume element; ABAQUS; cohesive elements","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","Aerospace Structures and Computational Mechanics","","","",""

(mentor); Lange, M. (mentor)","2016","Accurate thermal characterisation of composite structures can help structural designers in predicting thermal paths in a spacecraft structure and assessing the effect of modifying materials on the structure’s overall thermal performance. Existing spacecraft thermal analysis software lack the ability to model anisotropic thermal properties of composite materials. This in turn leads to inaccurate prediction of their thermal behaviour. The thesis describes the applied modelling methods and assumptions that are used to simulate the thermal characteristics of the MASCOT Landing Module’s (LM) composite structure. MASCOT is a 10 kg shoebox-sized lander platform developed by DLR in cooperation with CNES and JAXA for the Hayabusa 2 sample return mission from the asteroid 1999JU3. The MASCOT LM structure’s framework walls are made from a Carbon Fibre Reinforced Polymer/Foam sandwich. The M55J fibres used for the unidirectional sandwich face sheets are of Polyacrylonitrile (PAN) type and have high stiffness and strength properties, but poor thermal conductivity. Also, the glued connections between the framework walls are realised with PAN fibre patches. This is one reason, which necessitated a thermal sub-system consisting of heat pipes and a radiator. Both contribute with a total mass of 450 g, almost the same as the structural mass (550 g). Also, the structural design is itself influenced by the needs of the thermal subsystem. The modelling is carried out using Patran whereby methods to develop a thermal finite element model from the existing structural model are assessed and steady state analyses are carried out. To decrease the computational effort for radiation simulation, a novel method of developing radiation shell elements which are overlaid on the solid elements in the structure is described. Subsequently, the results from the finite element simulations are compared to actual temperature measurements, which were performed in a thermal vacuum chamber. The model is correlated with the test results and the method adopted is validated. The next phase of the thesis work involves the use of the developed thermal model to assess solutions for integrating the thermal functions within the LM structure. As a first step, the heat pipes are removed. The impact of the removal of the heat pipes on the LM is assessed and various design solutions are proposed for the MASCOT LM. From the simulations, it is concluded that it is indeed possible to remove the heat pipes from the LM and that a structure-integrated thermal subsystem can be achieved by introducing conductive interfaces in the structure.","thermal; composites; spacecraft; FEM","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2019-01-26","Aerospace Engineering","Space Systems Engineering","","","",""

(mentor); Tenpierik, M.J. (mentor); Krimm, J. (mentor)","2016","In a research of the World Health Organization (2011) it is shown that environmental noise is number two on the list of health risks. Environmental noise is linked to certain health conditions ranging from annoyance to heart attacks and is caused by the growing number of noise sources in the urban environment. An important aspect influencing the noise levels in an urban context are the hard, sound reflective, building materials that are mostly used. A recent study from Techen and Krimm (2014a) indicates that surfaces like this can change the noise levels 3 to 8 decibel. To reduce these increased noise levels this research tries to find an answer to the following question: how can an existing façade be adapted in such a way that the impact of the noise reflected by it will be reduced? To answer this question a case study location in Delft is chosen: the Herman Gorterhof. At this location most of the direct sound is blocked, so the sound levels are mostly influenced by reflected sound waves. Based on prior research and on on-site measurements it’s concluded that the most important noise source for this location is traffic noise from the nearby road. This source produces the highest levels for the frequencies of 1000 and 2000 Hertz. In order to define potential approaches to reduce reflections which are influencing the sound levels a literature study is conducted. Sound can be reduced when or before it’s reaching the façade by noise barriers, sound absorbing materials or resonating sound absorbers. For the sound absorbing solutions it’s especially important to consider weather effects which might damage the used materials. When it’s impossible to use these reduction methods the impact of the sound reflection can be reduced by influencing the (direction) of the reflected sound. This can for example be done by introducing an angle or by scattering the sound waves. A computer simulation is done to further investigate the impact of sound reflections at the chosen location and to test the potential solutions. To validate this model the found values are compared to the actually measured sound levels. From the simulations it followed that the sound levels improve up to 17,7 dB(A) when the façade completely consist of a (theoretical) 100% absorbing material. When looking at more realistic façade solutions to prevent reflections, façades which are reflecting the sound waves upward seem to perform the best. A solution like this has an average improvement of 5 dB(A) which is similar to the impact of the theoretical 100% absorbing solution. To investigate the best performing façade solutions in more detail scale model measurements are used. For these measurements a simplified 1:50 model is made from the chosen location and the possible façade solutions. The measurements are conducted in the small semi-anechoic room at the faculty of Applied Physics at the TU Delft. To validate this model the found values are compared to both the values from the on-site measurements as well as the values found using the computer simulations. Besides investigating the sound levels inside the courtyard of the chosen location this scale model is also used to determine the impact of the potential solutions on sound diffraction over nearby buildings, into more quiet areas. From these measurements it followed that the solution which would be reflecting the sound upward did indeed perform the best when just looking at the improvements in the courtyard area. However, when looking at the diffraction it caused over nearby buildings this solution performed the worst. The sound absorbing solution performed the best since this solution only absorbs the sound waves, not (potentially) sending them towards more quiet areas. Based on this results it’s decided to further investigate three potential façade solutions: an absorbing one, a solution which would only reflect the sound upward at the two lowest floors, and the already mentioned sound upward reflecting solution. The reason to add the solution which would only reflect sound upward at the lowest floors was that it performed better than the solution which is just absorbing sound while the impact on the diffracted sound was lower than the more reflecting solution. Based on the conducted measurements and simulations three façade designs are made. The first one is a façade that focusses on applying as much absorption as possible. For this design absorbing materials are selected which are sufficiently impact and weather resistant so they can be applied at the building façade. A porous concrete-like solution is applied at the lowest two floors and the tower which houses the circulation area of the building, while a perforated sound absorber is being used as sound absorbing parapet on the balconies. The second design focusses on reflecting the sound upward and therefore uses mostly hard building materials like glass. At the lowest eight floors a certain angle is introduced in such a way that the sound will be reflected over the nearby buildings, away from the courtyard. To achieve this the balconies need to be extended and closed off with a glass structure. Finally the third design combines the absorbing and the upward reflecting solutions. At the lowest two floors the sound will be reflected upward and at the higher floors the perforated sound absorbing parapet solutions are used to absorb the sound. To determine the impact of the three different façade designs on the sound levels inside the courtyard and on the sound which is being diffracted over the nearby buildings final scale model measurements are conducted. Furthermore the three designs are also rated looking at their architectural impact, complexity, costs and reusability. Using this data the design combining the sound absorption and the sound reflection is selected as the best performing solution, taking the defined context into account. While it improves the sound levels less than the upward reflecting design it only has a minor influence on the diffracted sound. Furthermore this design is still relatively cheap and easily constructed when being compared to the completely reflecting design. It’s expected that this design will on average improve the sound levels inside the investigated courtyard area 5 dB(A) with local improvements up to even 10 dB(A).","acoustics; sound reflections; façades; highrise; environmental noise; urban context","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Architecture and The Built Environment","Architectural Engineering and Technology","","Building Technology","","51.993499, 4.357437"

(mentor); Ledoux, H. (mentor); Gorte, B.G.H. (mentor)","2016","The recent emergence of Light Detection And Ranging (LiDAR) scanning technology has resulted in the availability of very large three dimensional point cloud data sets. These LiDAR data sets have become a main source for the modeling and reconstruction of both ground surface as well as above-ground objects such as buildings and vegetation. For the Netherlands, the second version of the Algemeen Hoogtebestand Nederland (AHN) is a country-wide high-resolution point cloud data set comprising the nation’s terrain by measuring heights, obtained by LiDAR, using Airborne Laser Scanning (ALS). None of the currently available raster-based products based on the AHN2 data set can be considered as being good: height maps contain holes, unintentional dynamic objects are present and more. Causes for errors can be found in deviations during the collection of the point cloud data as well as the applied methodology to process the data. This thesis will identify the possibilities to improve the quality of raster-based height map products based on the AHN2 data set with respect to currently available products. Quality will be determined with respect to the Geographic Information Quality principles standard, introduced by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO). A five-step methodology is proposed in order to generate raster-based height data from massive LiDAR point cloud samples from the AHN2 data set. In the first step, the massive LiDAR point cloud data will be split up in overlapping tiles in order to pipeline subsets of data in order to feed data sequentially to the computers’ main memory. In the second step filtering of different classes takes place in order to filter specific information within the point cloud data. In the third step, for each filtered class specific interpolation methods will be applied in order to achieve raster-based data from the point cloud data that fits best for a certain class of data. In the fourth step some post-processing steps will be applied in order to optimize the raster data and a composition of the tiles that were decomposed in the first step. In the fifth step raster visualization will be applied in order to support visual inspection of the data. Quality assessment shows that the methodology proposed within this thesis is capable to process data with a completeness rate of 100%. Positional accuracy is determined with respect to currently available raster-based height maps since no reference data is available. For Digital Elevation Model (DEM)s low positional errors are measured where for Digital Surface Model (DSM)s higher positional errors are measured due to erroneous data within current DSM products. Thematic accuracy is defined for a larger amount of classes in comparison with currently available raster-based height maps with a sensitivity rate between 56?100% ± 5%.","LiDAR; AHN2; height map; DEM; DSM","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Architecture and The Built Environment","Geomatics","","","",""

(mentor); Turrin, M. (mentor)","2016","Developments in additive manufacturing (AM) in engineering cause the adoption of a design approach with functionally graded printed cellular solids to become more feasible. Functionally graded materials, which are materials with a spatially varying composition, are omnipresent in nature. Such materials offer high material efficiency – thus resource efficiency. In contrast to natural materials and biological tissues, industrially fabricated constructions, such as concrete pillars, are typically volumetrically homogenous. While the use and application of homogenous materials allow for ease of production, many qualities - such as improvements in strength, weight, material usage, and functionality - could be obtained by the development and application of functionally graded materials at the product and architectural scales. To assess the potential of these cellular solids for the building industry, research has been constrained to the integration of thermal and structural performance. Furthermore, the design variables in the assessment have been constrained to porosity, shape, material properties and a linear gradient type. As input material properties, AM businesses have been consulted and conservative properties have been used. The material assessment shows that there is still room for improvement and these values might improve as a future prospect. Assessment shows that for printed polymers there are applications in insulating objects with low structural demands, such as structural façade elements. This is due to their general flexible behaviour, but impressive low conductive properties. For metals, the field of application is limited with this design approach, because of their high conductive properties. Instead, this property could be used advantageously in the design of a heat exchanger that also serves as structural object. Ceramics show potential to be used as load bearing components such as walls or pillars that also are optimized for either thermal buffering or thermal mass by adapting the porosity and/or heterogeneity corresponding to the thermal comfort requirement of the adjacent space.","AM","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Architecture and The Built Environment","Architectural Engineering + Technology","","Building Technology","",""

Het betreft een complexe opgave met sociale- en milieu problematiek (""ongelukkige"" bewoners) in sociale huisvesting met achterstallig onderhoud. De complexiteit komt voort uit de, veelal tegenstrijdige, belangen van de diverse partijen die met het gebied te maken hebben en de omgang met de bestaande situatie. De hoofdvraag: ""Hoe kunnen de wensen en behoeften van de bewoners en de eigenaar van de Dura Coignet portieketagewoningen in Rotterdam Lombardijen worden behartigd op een milieuvriendelijke manier?"" wordt beantwoord met een synthese van de antwoorden van de deelvragen. Het onderzoek wordt ingekaderd door het te richten op deze specifieke locatie. Binnen deze locatie zijn de wensen en belangen van de bewoners onderzocht door middel van literatuuronderzoek, interviews en een enquête. Daarnaast is er op basis van literatuur een inventarisatie gemaakt van milieumaatregelen die in dit gebied gerealiseerd zouden kunnen worden. Het antwoord op de hoofdvraag is waar belangen van bewoners en de woningbouwcorporatie, overlappen met milieumaatregelen. Om de hoofdvraag te beantwoorden is deze opgesplitst in behandelbare delen. Dit heeft geleid tot de volgende vier deelvragen: 1. Wat zijn de kenmerken en de sterke en zwakke punten van de Dura Coignet portieketagewoningen en hun omgeving in Rotterdam Lombardijen? 2. Wat zijn de wensen en behoeften van de bewoners van de Dura Coignet portieketagewoningen in Rotterdam Lombardijen? 3. Wat zijn de wensen en behoeften van woningcorporatie Havensteder ten opzichte van de Dura Coignet portieketagewoningen in Rotterdam Lombardijen? 4. Welke maatregelen aan de Dura Coignet portieketagewoningen in Rotterdam Lombardijen en de lokale omgeving zouden de milieubelasting (schade aan milieu) kunnen verlagen? Aan veel bewonerswensen blijkt tegemoet gekomen te kunnen worden met milieuvriendelijke maatregelen. Wanneer correct uitgevoerd, zouden nagenoeg alle milieumaatregelen directe voordelen op kunnen leveren voor de bewoners. Deze voordelen liggen op het gebied van gezondheid en comfort, maar ook in het beperken van overlast, veiligheid, controle, ontspanning, een aantrekkelijke omgeving, meer groen, het stimuleren van sociaal contact en ze kunnen in sommige gevallen op de langere termijn ook financieel voordelig zijn. Allemaal elementen die bewoners aangeven belangrijk te vinden. Daaruit blijkt een sterke overlap tussen milieumaatregelen en bewonerswensen. Binnen de wensen van de corporatie bestaat een conflict tussen wensen die goed zijn voor mens en milieu aan de ene kant, en de noodzaak voor financiële continuïteit aan de andere kant. Daarbij komt dat de investerende partij niet altijd de partij is die de (financiële) baten geniet. Financiering van veel milieumaatregelen is daardoor moeilijker. Mogelijk is dit probleem met toekomstige onderzoeken op te lossen. In antwoord op de hoofdvraag van dit onderzoek kan worden gesteld dat meeste wensen en behoeften van bewoners, en een deel van die van de corporatie, kunnen worden behartigd op een milieuvriendelijke wijze door milieumaatregelen te betrekken bij het ontwerp vanaf de allereerste planvorming.","","nl","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Architecture and The Built Environment","Architecture","","Veldacademie","","51.877940, 4.527386"

(mentor); Maaskant, B. (mentor); Mosselman, E. (mentor); Morales Napoles, O. (mentor); Buiteveld, H. (mentor); Hegnauer, M. (mentor)","2016","The Belgian Meuse is a river with a relatively low flood risk. The floodplains are narrow, and the estimated impact is not large until the flood reaches a magnitude of a once in a 200 years event. Flooding along the Belgian Meuse could however have an effect on the flood safety in the Netherlands, since there the flood defences are dimensioned on such extreme events. In addition, the climate is changing, causing more extreme rainfall in the Meuse basin. Therefore, knowledge of what will happen in case of extreme floods is becoming more important. Accurate numerical models and better estimates of extreme rainfall and flood events give the possibility to research flooding on the river Meuse. The goal of this thesis is to analyse extreme floods on the Belgian Meuse: What happens along this river under extreme conditions, and what are the consequences in the Netherlands? To analyse what areas along the Belgian Meuse are prone to flooding and how severe the flooding in these areas can be, a terrain analysis is carried out. This analysis shows that the river reach between Namur and the Dutch border is prone to flooding. The spatial limit that the flood could potentially have is not more than a few kilometres from the river axis, due to the valley shape of the floodplains. These flood prone areas have a potential storage capacity of 70 million m^3, and can thus have a significant influence on the flood wave. The valley shape of the Meuse ensures that there is no upper limit to the conveyance capacity, so the discharge at Eijsden has no cut-off level. A numerical model of the Belgian Meuse is built to simulate extreme floods. The new SOBEK 3.4 software, which combines SOBEK 1D and Flexible Mesh 2D, is used to build the model. Although the software is still under development, it has sufficient possibilities to model the area of research. The created flood model gives good results; it can reproduce the results from a similar but more accurate 2D model of the University of Liege. The resulting impact of the flooding on the discharge is a few percent damping, increasing gradually from nothing for once in 50 years wave to 7% for a once in 50,000 years wave. A sensitivity and uncertainty analysis are carried out to examine the uncertainties in the flood model. The first describes the selection of the parameters with the largest influence on the result. Two of these parameters, the main channel roughness and emergency measures, are further analysed in the uncertainty analysis. The main channel roughness gives the largest spread in discharge at Eijsden: a variation of 100 m^3 up or down. Placing sandbags has a small effect on the discharge, since these emergency measures will likely not be sufficient to protect the floodplains. A third parameter, the timing of the inflow from the side branches has a large influence too. It is recommended to use a smaller GRADE time step for the extreme events on the Meuse, since the timing is important for the fast genesis of floods in the Meuse basin. When combined with the uncertainties in the rainfall and run-off models, the contribution of the hydraulic uncertainty is minimal. When all GRADE uncertainties are incorporated in the design discharge curve, the impact of flooding along the Belgian Meuse leads to a maximum reduction of 100 m^3 compared to the case of no flooding. Considering flooding when determining the exceedance frequency curve is recommended, it gives a more realistic estimate for the discharge extremes. The hydrograph shape plays an important role here, since the wider wave compromises the effect of retention basins. It is thus also recommended to use a different, wider, hydrograph when considering flooding. The water level reduction due to flooding is estimated to be up to 30 cm along the Dutch Meuse. The current method of determining discharge extremes, HR2006, gives lower discharges than GRADE. When switching to the GRADE frequency curve with (or without) flooding and with uncertainty, the same safety standards will give higher design conditions. By considering flooding, these higher GRADE values are mitigated.","flooding; flood risk; Meuse; GRADE; SOBEK 3.4; discharge extremes","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","Hydraulic Engineering","","50.53554, 5.27882"

Extensive literature review, interviews and aspect studies on both the circular economy concept and the construction industry have resulted in a new definition of circular economy with corresponding boundary conditions. With these boundary conditions, conventional business models of building product providers (suppliers) have been critically assessed. By doing this, 13 costs and risks have been identified and incorporated in the design of the financial section of a business model. At last, the business model has been assessed by means of a case study: providing the structure of a steel beam.

A user need analysis has been conducted by means of literature review, expert interviews and case studies. This led to a description of the process, the involved stakeholders and bottlenecks in the process. 22 bottlenecks have been identified in the process, these bottlenecks can be put in the categories ‘stakeholder collaborations’, ‘knowledge level’, ‘funding’ and ‘context’. In the research synthesis a link between these bottlenecks and possible information input from open data is made. This led to an analysis of available open data sets in the Netherlands that might aid the renovation process. 57 data sets were identified to be useful for the process. Since none of the bottlenecks has the lack of data or information as its origin, it is unlikely that the implementation of open data would directly solve the bottlenecks. However, it could facilitate to reduce some of the bottlenecks. In this report a framework is presented which could be used by stakeholders in the process as a guideline to find useful data sets in the open data database of the Dutch government. To make the implementation possible the level of awareness and transparency in the process should be raised.

(mentor); Zijlema, M. (mentor); Bosboom, J. (mentor); Klein, M.D. (mentor)","2016","Alongshore currents are currents parallel to the coastline. In coastal areas they are driven by a combination of wave and tidal forcing. In this study, the validity of the non-hydrostatic, wave-flow model SWASH to predict these currents is investigated. This is done by comparing model predictions with measurement observations. Observations were obtained from the COAST3D data-set at the gently sloping barred beach near Egmond. It contains six weeks of wave and velocity measurements for a wide range of conditions. An initial study was performed to investigate model settings and parameter sensitivity for correctly capturing wave dynamics. From this study, it can be concluded that two terrain-following layers and 75 grid cells per wave length lead to accurate results for surf zone wave modelling. Although some discrepancies in mean water level set-up were encountered, this is assumed not to affect alongshore current predictions. The present SWASH model does not allow for the inclusion of alongshore tidal currents. Therefore, this study presents a method to include tidal forcing, which was implemented in the source code. This method enables the user to include the tide by imposing a water level gradient, which is assumed to be time averaged and spatially uniform. These assumptions are reasonable as spatial and temporal model scales are small compared to a tidal wave. Validation results demonstrate the capability of SWASH to correctly represent wave transformation in a surf zone. Furthermore, modelled velocity predictions are in good agreement with observations for cases with waves from southwest and northward flood tidal currents, which were not disturbed by instabilities. Cases with different forcing were influenced by instabilities due to a bug in the source code. Two cases, which were least influenced by the instabilities, have been analysed in more detail as well. Some discrepancies are observed between model and observations. Further study is required to evaluate whether this is caused by the instabilities, introduced by the bug in the source code, or whether other physical phenomena play a role in the mismatch. Inertia of a tidal wave and bottom friction and processes which could potentially be the cause of the discrepancies.","SWASH; alongshore current; numerical modelling; COAST3D; Egmond; validation study","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","Environmental Fluid Dynamics","",""

However, a complication is that currently no insight exists in what factors can explain channel preferences of customers. These factors are required for estimating the channel preferences of customer. In order to identify these factors a survey has been used to collect channel preferences of banking customers in the context of outbound contact. Furthermore, hypotheses about what factors are expected to explain channel preferences were constructed. These hypotheses have been tested through multinomial logistic regression models. Multiple relations between channel preference and predictors were identified. To assess the impact of the findings on the presented problems, it is recommended to start pilots in which the selection of a channel to reach a customer is based on the identified predictors.","multi-channel management; channel preferences; multinomial logistic regression; outbound communication; financial sector","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Technology, Policy and Management","Multi Actor Systems","","Systems Engineering, Policy Analysis and Management","",""

(mentor)","2016","SCOPE The Dutch National Opera & Ballet (NO&B) is one of the largest cultural organisations in the Netherlands, and one of the top five of its kind in the world. They are the leading Dutch organisation for opera and ballet. The Dutch Opera and the Dutch National Ballet were separate entities until they recently merged, together with the Amsterdam Music Theatre, into one institution at the beginning of 2013. The goal of this project was to redesign the touchpoints of the new NO&B so that they optimise the experience of both the ballet and the opera visitors and add to the mission of the brand, which is to have all aspects of the NO&B experience rated as a 9 or higher by the visitors. RESEARCH After an analysis of the organisation and qualitative research amongst visitors, it was found that the main strengths of the Dutch National Opera & Ballet lie in the fact that they are the only institute in The Netherlands that produces the entire production in-house. This is unique, and can provide extra value for visitors. Their communication regarding these strengths can be stronger, however. The direction of this project was therefore to improve the communication of production and craftsmanship through a redesign of the shop of the NO&B. THEATRE SHOP The shop is redesigned through di erent aspects such as interior, assortment and online. They are based on ‘superior simplicity’ and abstractly referring to ‘backstage’ with style elements and products that put emphasis on the craftsmanship behind the scenes. For instance, a column in the shop is used as a exhibition element that displays playful examples of how much work and effort is done behind the scenes. The assortment of the shop is adjusted to fit the new shop and the brand, including items inspired by specific performances. The craftsmanship is integrated in the product assortment through ‘hero- items’: limited edition items that are made in the atelier of Dutch National Opera & Ballet.","retail; theatre; customer journey; branding","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Product Innovation Management","","","",""

(mentor)","2016","Foam can divert flow from higher- to lower-permeability layers and thereby improve vertical sweep efficiency in gas-injection enhanced oil recovery. Recently, Kapetas et al. (2015) measured foam properties in cores from four sandstone formations ranging in permeability from 6 to 1900 md, and presented parameter values for a foam-model fit to those data. Permeability affects the limiting capillary pressure at which foam collapses in the ""high-quality regime"". Kapetas et al. showed how foam would divert injection between layers of these formations if all layers were full of foam at a given quality (gas fractional flow). Here we examine the effects of SAG (surfactant-alternating-gas) injection method on diversion in a dynamic foam process using fractional-flow modelling and the model parameters derived by Kapetas et al. We consider a hypothetical reservoir containing non-communicating layers with the properties of the four formations in that study. The effectiveness of diversion varies greatly with injection method. In a SAG process, diversion of the first slug of gas depends on foam behaviour at high foam quality. Foam mobility in the foam bank during gas injection depends on the nature of a shock front that bypasses most foam qualities usually studied in the laboratory. The foam with the lowest mobility at fixed foam quality does not necessarily give the lowest mobility in a SAG process. In particular, diversion depends on how and whether foam collapses at low water saturation; this property varies greatly among the foams reported by Kapetas et al. Moreover, diversion depends on the size of the surfactant slug received by each layer before gas injection. This of course favours diversion away from high-permeability layers that receive a large surfactant slug, but there is an optimum surfactant slug size: too little surfactant and diversion from high-permeability layers is not effective; too much and mobility is reduced in low-permeability layers, too. Using a model based directly on laboratory data, this study shows how diversion between layers differs with injection method.","SAG; mobility control; layered reservoirs; Effect of Permeability on Foam Parameters","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Geoscience & Engineering","","Petroleum Engineering & Geosciences","",""

(mentor); Quak, W. (mentor)","2016","The massive developments and uses of high rise buildings indicate that the demand for use of space above and below the ground surface is rapidly increasing in recent years. In the context of this thesis, the research is focused on exploring the possibilities of linking 3D legal RRR spaces, modeled with LADM (ISO 19152), with physical reality of 3D objects. The possibilities are explored towards the development of a prototype which is elaborated in two core stages: At first, a physical model is derived from the corresponding conceptual model, using existing national and international standards and then, its efficiency is tested using real world sample data, querying the database and visualizing the result in 3D environment. The conceptual modeling of the proposed model is based on the ""people to land"" relationship using LADM core concepts described with UML diagrams. Towards the conversion from conceptual model to implementation of a working prototype, the model is first converted into the INTERLIS modeling language, in order to be formally expressed including various constraints in a platform/ vendor neutral manner. INTERLIS is a standard modeling language for geodata exchange which is used to provide more direct implementable models and at the same time support the constraints. The model described, initially, with UML diagrams and especially the constraints in OCL cannot be automatically converted into implementations. During the prototype, emphasis is given at the exploitation of the capabilities of INTERLIS, under the scope of LADM, which is used in actual implementation of land administration system. INTERLIS tools are used to automatically generate implementation components for specific environments; e.g. database schema or exchange file format. Challenges among others during the system's development cycle include the following: how to express the various LADM constraints OCL and semi-formal in standard) formally in INTERLIS, how to include extensible hierarchical code lists in INTERLIS models (not natively available) and distinguish them from enumeration values, how to model 3D volumetric primitives in INTERLIS (not natively available), how to link two models (legal - physical) using cross domain constraints, etc. The system’s development cycle, is illustrated with a proposed model for MLAS in Greece. The model is based on international standards, covering a broader perspective than the existing one used today, including several types of objects and interests that are not currently registered by the Hellenic Cadastre. More precisely, utility networks (both the legal and their physical counterpart), planning zones, marine parcels and 3D (land) parcels are now included at the proposed model and organized appropriately. The different types of spatial units are organized in levels according to the LA_Level structure of LADM, ISO19152. This model is considered as an effort for overcoming these shortcomings, based on international standards, including the representation of a wide range of different types of spatial units, in three dimensions, aiming to establish an appropriate basis for the NSDI of Greece. It is a flexible proposal for comprehensive multipurpose LAS supporting both 2D and 3D cadastral registration in Greece. The prototype is developed in order to evaluate the strengths and limitations of the proposed conceptual model (linking legal and physical objects), as well as to investigate the efficiency and limitations of the existing technological (INTERLIS) tools. The process followed during the prototype development is cyclical and repetitive, providing feedback to the initial model during all the stages and improving it in terms of efficiency, reality and technical implementation. Finally, differences and similarities are mentioned from the comparison of the final (corrected) conceptual model, which results after the evaluation of the prototype, with the initial one. Conclusions and remarks made based on the database queries and visualization, as well as similarities, differences and patterns can be observed between the legal and physical objects. All the design and technical decisions that were taken during the system’s development cycle together with the problems arised, the solutions proposed and challenges for future work are described at the following chapters.","Land Administration Domain Model; INTERLIS; constraints; 3D Cadastre; legal and physical space; 3D cadastral data modeling","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Architecture and The Built Environment","OTB","","Geomatics","",""

According to literature one of the aspects that is less addressed, by current available products that are compatible with virtual reality, is the sense of touch. This master thesis shows the Research and development of a haptic feedback glove for Virtual engineer training environments. Which enhances and/or provide a more realistic task performance. This assignment was performed for Manus-VR a Startup company that works on a data glove which makes it possible to see your own hands in a virtual space. To deal with the complexity of this assignment, the design process will be divided (1) Analysis, (2) Conceptualization, (3) Prototyping, (4) Validation and (5) final design proposal. Chapter 1 Analysis: The aim of this chapter is to create a basic understanding about the selected search area. Therefore, first a Market and Technology overview on the current market segmentation and technological developments is made. Second, a to have a better understanding on haptics theory, the most important aspects are summarized (Stimuli-context-user). Third and last, the user scenarios, actions and context are studied. Finalizing with a program of requirements which will be used as a guideline towards a useful product concept. Chapter 2 Conceptualization: In this chapter three concepts are generated. Learning by doing is the predominant design approach implemented in this section. This means that early in the process simple prototypes are made to test volume, size and functionality of ideas. Drawings will support the ideation process to clarify ideas and work mechanisms. The concepts will be presented and evaluated using a harris profile. The selected concept is the “Click on handle glove” which will be further prototyped. Chapter 3 Prototyping: The prototyping process is divided into two phases P1 and P2. P1 prototypes are focused on the three aspects of the “Click on handle glove” which are fingertip deformation, haptic handle and actuation. These are prototyped to a proof of concept level. For research purposes there will be a need to focus on only one aspect, to be able to perform valuable user research. P2 is the stage where the handle is fully developed with electronics and is ready to be be validated. Chapter 4 Validation: To validate the functionalities of the haptic handle, it was necessary to develop Virtual tasks in an immersive environment. Therefore research protocols and methods were studied and selected to be able to develop a reasonable research approach. This consisted of measuring subjective and objective data while users were performing the tasks. The subjective data is acquired by a questionnaire and objective data by observations and angular positional data that is logged out from the program used (unity3D). Chapter 5 Final design proposal: From the results acquired recommendations for redesigns are suggested and a final design proposal is presented with an holistic view to the future. The project ends with a design proposal of the “Manus exter glove”. The report ends with conclusions about the whole process and some recommendations about the user interactions, market introduction and further research possibilities. Following it up with a personal reflection of the process and achievements will be further presented.","Haptic feedback; Virtual learning environments; Engineer training; Haptic glove","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Design Engineering","","Master of Science Integrated Product Design","",""

(mentor); Sebastiano, F. (mentor)","2016","Temperature sensors are widely integrated in high performance systems, e.g. microprocessors. If the die temperature becomes too high, the processor must throttle its clock speed to prevent reliability problems. This application requires temperature sensors that can be integrated in the same advanced technologies as the microprocessor, and that can operate from the same low supply voltage. Since many temperature sensors are required, it is important that they only require a minimal amount of trimming. Thermal noise can be exploited as a temperature sensing principle in any technology with resistive elements. Since thermal noise is a fundamental physical phenomenon, it is inherently accurate and linear. The noise power only depends on the measurement bandwidth, which can be easily calibrated. Previous noise-based temperature sensors required very long measurement times to achieve decent resolution. This is because only small measurement bandwidths could be achieved with discrete measurement setups. By integrating the noise-thermometer on chip, and using the increasing speed of more advanced technologies to our advantage, resolution can greatly improve. This thesis presents the first on-chip noise-based temperature sensor. A prototype chip has been fabricated in a standard 160 nm CMOS process and it achieves a resolution of 0.93 °C in 1 s. The sensor can achieve an inaccuracy of 6.8 °C (3?) from -70 °C to 50 °C with a single point trim and an inaccuracy of 6.1 °C (3?) from -70 °C to 95 °C with a two-point trim. The sensor occupies a die area of 0.15 mm2 and consumes 1.9 mW from a 1.8 V supply.

(mentor); Huijsing, J.H. (mentor)","2016","A sampled voltage reference aims to achieve both low-power and low-noise by storing the output of a voltage reference on a capacitor for a long time. This allows the reference to be switched off during the hold period, which leads to lower average power. At the same time, all the voltage reference's noise is pushed down into a bandwidth determined by the refresh frequency, while the buffer can be made low-noise by auto-zeroing. The design of a continuous-time auto-zeroed buffer with low-noise and low-offset is presented. Various techniques have been used to reduce the transients created by auto-zeroing. In simulation the transients are below 1 µV peak-to-peak, but the effectiveness of the techniques could not be evaluated in measurements. The design of a low leakage sample and hold circuit is also presented. This uses bootstrap techniques to maintain zero potential across critical parasitic diodes. It is shown to be effective, resulting in a drift of about 5 µV per second. A mechanism is found which explains how the buffer's residual offset is transferred to the hold capacitor. A special slow-chopping technique is presented and implemented to try to reverse the leakage due to this residual offset. The final implemented design suffers from a large coupling between the high frequency reference clock and the output. It is shown that this causes a much higher residual offset than expected, which in turn increases the leakage of the hold capacitor. With a measured residual offset in the order of several 100 µVs and an auto-zeroing frequency of 2 kHz, the leakage in 1 s is 34 mV. Via simulation it is shown that with a lower residual offset, the leakage can be greatly reduced. Methods of improving the current design have been investigated. A new clocking scheme is proposed and simulated. Improvements to the buffer are also proposed, which should lower its 1/f noise corner. This would allow for a lower auto-zeroing frequency, which in turn will further reduce the leakage.","Sampled Voltage Reference; Duty-cycling; Low power; Low noise; Low leakage; Sample-and-hold; Low Switching transients; Continuous-time auto-zeroed buffer; Low offset; Charge kickback; Slow-chopping; Dead time","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2021-01-01","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Microelectronics","","Electronic Instrumentation","",""

(mentor); Veldhuis, L.L.M. (mentor)","2016","As the aviation industry continues to strive for improvements in fuel efficiency throughout the entire aircraft design, interest has been renewed in propeller engines. New research into advanced turboprop engines, so-called open rotor engines, seems promising as they combine the inherent high propulsive efficiency of ordinary turboprop engines, with the capability of delivering higher thrust. Unfortunately, the implementation of propeller engines does have significant implications on the stability and controllability of an aircraft. These implications are primarily caused by the propeller slipstream, the complex streamtube behind the propeller with strong gradients in various flow quantities both in streamwise and radial direction. The objective of this thesis was to develop, implement, and validate a prediction method for the propeller slipstream effect on the longitudinal stability and control of conventional aircraft configurations in the Initiator. During the investigation of the propeller slipstream effect, an existing prediction method was found which was based on calculating the four major effects caused by the propeller slipstream on the longitudinal stability and control. These four effects are, an additional normal force at the propeller disk, an increase in lift over the wing due to the slipstream, a change in the tail-off pitching moment, and a change in tail contribution to the pitching moment due to increased downwash and dynamic pressure. This method seemed ideal as it not only gives relatively accurate results, but does so with computationaly inexpensive calculations. During the implementation of this method in the Initiator, additional changes were made to calculate aerodynamic variables which were previously estimated using an extended vortex lattice method program. This implemented prediction method was validated using the only available wind tunnel data for the Fokker 50 and a special Saab 340 with T-tail configuration. Through this validation, the prediction method proved to maintain an acceptable accuracy for all configurations with minimal computation time. Further analysis of the results showed that the propeller slipstream effect reduces the tail effectiveness due to an increase in downwash angle at the tail. This was especially the case for the Fokker 50, which due to its low wing configuration, has a further increase in downwash caused by an inflow effect of the outer flow into the streamtube.","aircraft design; initiator; propeller slipstream; longitudinal stability and control","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","Flight Performance and Propulsion","","Flight Performance and Propulsion","",""

It can be concluded that alignment of the dominant factors in crowdfunding real estate with the nation's institutional principles and welfare situation are vital to the emergence of a resilient and viable crowdfunding real estate market. Stimulating these factors requires the effort of both government and market. The Dutch government is required to initiate and support crowdfunding in combination with a cooperative regulator (AFM).

Although widely investigated and often mentioned in literature, the concept of supply chain collaboration is not precisely defined (Barratt, 2004). It can be roughly described as: collaboration in the supply chain are all the joint efforts of the stakeholders within a supply chain to improve the overall performance(Barratt & Oliveira, 2001; Barratt, 2004). Procter & Gamble (P&G) can be regarded as one of the largest fast moving consumer goods (FMCG) companies in the world (MBASkool, 2015). Although performing quite well, P&G feels that they can still improve their supply chain (Olsthoorn, 2015). They have expressed the feeling that their main challenge lies in improving their supply chain while being more externally focused (Demange, 2015). P&G have therefore issued this specific project; assessing the effects of vertical collaboration in (one of) their supply chain(s) and provide a handle on how to implement this concept. This master thesis report discusses the effect of vertical collaboration in a two-level supply chain; collaboration between manufacturer (Procter & Gamble) and the retailer (Retailer X). With the help of a case-study on the product Dreft Automatic Dishwashing (ADW), the goal was to quantify the effect of increased vertical collaboration within a real-life supply chain. To help structure this research the following research question was drafted: “Could vertical collaboration in the supply chain of Dreft ADW lead to better service, cost and cash results?” In order to develop an answer to this question, first a literature study was conducted to better define the concept of vertical collaboration. Then, based on a data-analysis on the current state of the supply chain, the problem areas were disclosed for which interventions were devised on the basis of the concept of vertical collaboration. Subsequently, an Agent-Based Model (ABM) of the supply chain of Dreft ADW was designed, to simulate the effects of these interventions so as to provide the data on the effects of vertical collaboration in the supply chain of Dreft ADW. With the aid of the model we were able to both answer the research question as well as to provide the problem owner (Procter & Gamble) an approach to best optimize their supply chain by using the concept of vertical collaboration. The interventions that were used to embody the effect of vertical collaboration and subsequently tested in the ABM were: - Production batch size alignment to retailer orders. - Alignment of order information sharing process between retailer and manufacturer during promotions or continuous interaction. - Use of real-time up-to-date information throughout the supply chain in ordering and replenishment. - Use of POS data in the ordering and replenishment process. The results of the model show that vertical collaboration in the supply chain of Dreft ADW could indeed lead to better service cost and cash results. By implementing the interventions in four sequent steps, service levels can be increased without increasing inventory levels. Next to that, cost savings of up to 2.4% of the gross value of the sold products can be achieved.","supply chain; collaboration; optimization; FMCG; agent-based modeling; batch-size; real-time information; stakeholder alignment","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Technology, Policy and Management","Engineering Systems and Services","","Transport and Logistics","",""

The semi-linear elliptic boundary value problem is analysed by proving the existence of a unique solution and optimal control as well as deriving necessary optimality conditions. The problems are discretized using Finite Volume and Finite Element methods. However, the PDE being semi-linear, causes an additional issue, therefore the Newton’s method is introduced to linearize the equation. The aim of this paper is to present and apply different optimization methods and discretization techniques to find state and control which minimize the corresponding cost functional for linear and semi-linear PDEs. In the first optimization method the linear optimal control problem is transformed into reduced quadratic optimization problem and solved using ”quadprog” algorithm in MATLAB. In the second method both problems are optimized using ”fmincon” algorithm in two separate ways: with and without gradient of the reduced cost functional. After comparing the results, the first way was proved to be much faster as a lot of time is saved having the gradient calculated and supplied prior optimization. Finally, the projected gradient method is introduced. Overall, this last method was proved to be the most efficient.","Finite Volume Method; Finite Element Methods; Optimal Control; Semi-linear elliptic equations; distributed optimal control; quadratic optimization problem; quadprog; MATLAB; fmincon","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Applied Mathematics","","Erasmus Mundus COSSE","",""

There is however some discussion whether this assumption is valid or not. The current research tries to compute the body force field by using a numerical optimization procedure, using a \matlab optimization routine combined with an \openfoam solver which was adapted to accommodate for the body force term. Many simplifications had to be made to be able to perform the optimization in a reasonable amount of time, among which were a fairly coarse numerical grid, a first order discretisation scheme and a parametrization of the body force field. Due to this last simplification, no real conclusions can be drawn with regard to the spatial distribution of the body force, but the integral body forces in x- and y-direction display more or less valid behaviour and correspond to previous research. It is also shown that the pressure gradient has the same order of magnitude as the body force density in all 8 cases, which means that this research challenges the assumption that the pressure gradient is of little importance when trying to obtain the body force from velocity data.","plasma actuator; AC-DBD; optimization; body force","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","Aerodynamics, Wind Energy, Flight Performance and Propulsion","","Aerodynamics","",""

(mentor); Verhagen, H.J. (mentor); Kuiper, C. (mentor); Van den Berg, B. (mentor); Van Gent, M.R.A. (mentor)","2016","Breakwaters with single layer concrete armour are very commonly applied nowadays. Much research is available on the stability of single layer armour units on the seaward slope. However, rear slopes design methods for single layer armour units are rare. On rear side slopes usually similar sized units as on the seaward slope are applied. Limited design methods are available for the stability of concrete armour units on the rear side of a breakwater. To obtain stability information on single layer cubes on the rear side, scale model tests have been performed in the wave flume of the University of Technology Delft. The purpose of the model tests is to obtain a relation between the overtopping wave characteristics (overtopping volume of an individual wave event and the overtopping wave front velocity) and the stability of the cubes at the rear slope of low crested breakwaters. This relation can lead to a more optimal rear side breakwater design. The test programme consists of different configurations, in which the following parameters have been varied: - Wave steepness: three typical values for steepness have been tested s_op=0.015, 0.027 and 0.039; - Relative crest width: relative crest width ranges were W_c/H_s= 1.1 6.3; - Relative free board: relative free board ranges were R_c/H_s= 0.4 1.3; - Rear slope angle: two slope angles of 1:2 and 1:1.5 have been tested; - Packing density; packing densities of 73% and 69% have been tested A total of 11 breakwater configurations have been tested. Each configuration was tested with a sequence of waves with increasing wave height until failure of the armour layer occurred. The focus was on the determination of start of damage of the rear armour cubes, but also on filter material wash out. Together with the stability tests, wave overtopping volume tests have been performed. The overtopping volume per wave was measured in a special designed box. The overtopping wave front velocity at the crest is measured by correlating the signals of two wave gauges. The number of displaced cubes in the rear slope armour layer has been determined with image analyses and expressed in the damage number N_od. The influences of the various parameters and overtopping characteristics on the rear slope damage are presented in stability graphs. Due to lack of sufficient data points, no trend line could be established. However, the graphs can be used as a guideline for conceptual breakwater design. The critical overtopping characteristics are in a wide range. Therefore, the quantitative influence of the overtopping velocity and -volume on the rear slope damage is unclear. This suggest that other aspects may influence the stability of the rear slope, for example the transmission through the breakwater or the shape of the overtopping flow around the rear slope. The analysis of the test data shows that damage on the single layer cubes on breakwater rear sides occurs later than expected. The expected cube dimensions were calculated for various configurations. First, the armour dimension of randomly placed rock is calculated with the formula of van Gent and Pozueta [2004]. Secondly, the difference in stability of randomly placed rocks and regular placed cubes was estimated applying a factor obtained from the known stability numbers on seaward slopes of both armour layers. The estimated cube dimension was used in a first test series. During this test series (almost) no damage was observed. Therefore, the remainder of the experiment was carried out with a 37% smaller cube diameter. The damage seems to be limited to first rows below the water level, which may indicate that cubes on the rear side below this level could be lighter.","breakwater; rear slope; stability; overtopping","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","","",""

The main challenge for this extension is the scheduling sequence as it must be the same in both the reference and gradient experiments. To address this problem two compensation methods were devised, which allowed the algorithm to compensate for changes in the scheduling sequence. These compensation methods led to two distinct disadvantages namely; the need for a model of the plant (extended regressor) and the curse of dimensionality (lifted LPV-ARX).

An example of a measuring method is the use of a drifter, which is common for nearshore applications, but less for rivers. Therefore the feasibility of a drifter is tested in the Yangon River. The design includes amongst others drogues, which try to follow the governing velocity, and a GPS-tracker. This design was calibrated, where the number of drogues is adjusted to five. During the measurement campaign a flow meter was used to find the best fit for which depth the drifter measures its velocities, according to the weighted least squares error method. With this results, the values are scaled to a line of best fit. Subsequently the results are compared with a simulation, in which the already scaled results are adjusted to their respective direction.

(mentor)","2016","The existence of tidal flat is beneficial for human beings, but it faces the risk of being vanished by continuous intervention, either by nature or human. Therefore, researches about tidal-flat’s morphodynamics are required for the sake of its preservation. Here, the subject of the research is the Kapellebank tidal flat in the Westerschelde estuary and the field measurement was performed for approximately 1 month. The objective of the study is to understand the hydrodynamics and the resultingmorphodynamics of the tidal flat. The analysis on the measurement data reveals the dominant filling-emptying mechanism at the flanks of the tidal flat. The water from theWesterschelde enters the Kapellebank tidal flat from one flank and it leaves from the other flank. The tidal-flat’s hydrodynamics are also heavily influenced by the spring-neap cycle and the wind speed variation. The spring-neap cycle determines the scale of the flowvelocity as the deeper spring tide propagates faster than the shallower neap tide. Meanwhile, the high wind-speed changes the flood-ebb pattern, creates the local wave, and generates the return current at the tidal flat. The erosion of the tidal flat is mainly caused by the imbalanced sediment flux during the period of the strong wind. As the storm generates the return current, it transports the sediment from the tidal flat toward offshore. Consequently, the bed level of the Kapellebank is eroded as there is more sediment outflux than the sediment influx. The measurement reveals the bottom level of the tidal flat decreased during the stormperiod, but it gradually increased again during the calm wind period. In the end, there was not much change in the bed level hence it can be deduced that the tidal flat is in the dynamic equilibrium. And, as the factors which influence the morphodynamics of the tidal flat are expected to exhibit similar pattern in long term, the Kapellebank tidal flat is expected to remain in the dynamic equilibrium.","tidal flat; morphodynamics; spring-neap cycle; wind speed variation; suppresed ebb current; imbalanced sediment flux; dynamic equilibrium","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","Environmental Fluid Dynamics","",""

(mentor); Veltkamp, M. (mentor)","2016","FiberCore Europe is a Dutch company, specialized in the design and manufacturing of composite, load-bearing structures for architecture and infrastructure. The company’s main focus is on bridges and lock gates made from glass fiber reinforced polymer (GFRP). The price for currently produced GFRP bridges longer than approximately 26 meter is often higher than the price for bridges made from conventional steel or reinforced concrete. FiberCore Europe is looking for ways to lower the material costs for longer composite bridges to expand their market. This research focusses on two solutions to lower the material costs. These solutions are based on the implementation of stiffer material in the current GFRP bridge concept. Doing so yields a hybrid composite structure. The two materials addressed in this study are structural steel and standard modulus carbon fibers. Combining glass fibers, polyester and fully embedded steel or carbon fibers in large, load-bearing civil engineering structures is a new topic. This requires research on material behavior and design modelling. Tests are performed to assess the corrosion characteristics of steel embedded in GFRP and the strength of the adhesive bond between GFRP and steel. A comparison of 14 different carbon fiber fabrics was made to determine the most suitable carbon fabric in combination with a polyester matrix. Hybrid carbon-glass-polyester laminates were built and tested. A design model has been created to compare different hybrid design sub-concepts with each other and with the reference GFRP bridge. The model is implemented in a Microsoft Excel design tool. The tool shows that it is possible to lower the material costs, the mass and the design height of a GFRP bridge simultaneously by embedding steel. Carbon fibers can lower the mass and the design height of the bridge even more, but only at increased material costs. Initial concerns with respect to the interfacial bond strength between carbon fibers and polyester were confirmed. Taking the total costs of ownership into account, hybrid composite bridges are cheaper than bridges from conventional materials. This is mainly due to the savings on maintenance costs over a design lifetime of 100 years.","composite bridge; hybrid material; carbon fiber; glass fiber; steel; polyester","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","Aerospace Structures and Materials","","Design and Production of Composite Structures","",""

Individuals infected by multiple strains referred to as a mixed infection are associated with poor treatment outcomes when the infecting strains differ in their susceptibility against antibiotics. Studies aimed to detect mixed infections are likely to underestimate the true prevalence of mixed infections, because conventional genotypic methods have limited sensitivity to distinguish TB strains. Tools are needed to distinguish strains at a finer resolution and allow the simultaneous detection of multiple strains. Whole genome sequencing yields more information and therefore provides increased resolution to also distinguish closely related strains. In this study, I detect mixed infections by using a large number of group-specific SNP markers obtained from sequence data. I associated SNPs to clusters in the MTBC phylogenetic tree to obtain cluster-specific SNP markers that allow detecting and estimating frequencies of present strain types at different levels in the phylogeny. The prevalence of mixed infections was found to be ~10% of which half were mixed at the sub-lineage level. Approximately 15% of the mixed infections were found to have ambiguous SNPs corresponding to locations that are known to cause drug resistance, indicating the presence of MTB populations with differing drug susceptibility profiles. The results show that patient-level multi-drug resistance can be caused by multiple strains each with their own resistance to a particular drug. This work illustrates the dire need for high-resolution molecular diagnostics that can pinpoint the exact nature of the infection.","tuberculosis; WGS; drug resistance; SNP; phylogenetic tree; hierarchical clustering; mixed infection","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Intelligent Systems","","Bioinformatics","",""

Since human beings’ existence cannot be separated from space and its man-made forms, built environment can alter people through embedded biases. And these biases are mostly manifested by accepted life-styles and consequently by particular design approaches that promote particular understandings, ideologies, belief systems or values over others. Considering the human activities that form the space under the name of architecture, the entirety of built environment supposedly encompasses the human needs. When it is about the spatial human needs, the quality of space is not only responsible to shelter and organize human life, but also responsible for the intuitive and spiritual needs of human nature. Freedom of imagination can be provided by space that unfolds the authenticity of human emancipation, which requires the integration of the spiritual and the artistic during spatial experience. On a larger scale, in today’s modern life, cities and buildings are human-made places that merely organize human life, instead of involving these intuitive human needs. Cities don’t speak of the spiritual, but, on purpose, keep people’s attention focused on the mechanically fixed patterns of human community itself. The modern city is today a mass movement, and the streets, with their high potential to be publicly used, are invaded by modern mobility under the name of freedom of accessibility. Considering the existed priorities of modern urban fabric, such as productively and fastness, streets are the places where these rituals happen in a plural form. The position of streetscape zones might offer a new layer for spirituality, which is experienced individually but encompassed publically.","spiritual experience; transcending architecture; poetics of space; urban fabric; mobility; streetscape","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Architecture and The Built Environment","Architecture","","Explore Lab","","39.920659, 32.854110"

(mentor)","2016","Solar sailing is a propulsion method using sunlight as energy source, meaning it does not make use of propellants as conventional methods do. The principle of solar sailing is simple: a large lightweight sail acts as a mirror reflecting impinging light. According to the wave-particle duality light can be interpreted as a stream of photons travelling at the speed of light. As these photons impinge upon a solar sail, they transfer their momentum on the sail and thus the spacecraft. This energy transferred is the propulsive force in solar sailing. The achievable force is in the order of mN and thus not very large, but in the frictionless environment that space is it can have considerable effects. Since this force works continuously, the energy input can rise to vast levels over time. One of the possible applications for using a solar sail on a space mission is a displaced geostationary orbit. A geostationary satellite remains at a fixed position with respect to Earth's surface due to its orbital characteristics. A natural geostationary orbit can only be achieved at a specific altitude, eccentricity and inclination, meaning all geostationary satellites orbit the Earth in exactly the same orbital plane. This limitation causes the geostationary band to get more crowded every year and this is why the concept of displaced geostationary satellites is interesting. For this concept, a satellite is put in an orbit that is altered in order to lay outside the standard geostationary band while the relevant orbital properties remain constant and its position thus stays fixed above the Earth' surface. In this thesis a spacecraft equipped with a solar sail is used to achieve such a displaced orbit. Even though the thrust levels possible using a solar sail are limited, the fact that it allows for continuous thrust and does not rely on any propellant make it a promising candidate for this concept. This thesis investigates the feasibility of this idea. A differential evolutionary algorithm is used to search for orbital trajectories that fulfil the set requirements. Promising results were found considering increasing vertical displacement of the orbital plane above the equatorial plane. Using a sail performance of 1 mm/s2 and a trajectory of three revolutions, a displaced orbit with an average offset of 3 km with respect to the desired position throughout the trajectory was found. These results were found considering the most favourable conditions valid around the winter solstice. During other periods of the year, the direction of the sunline has changed and the performance of the solutions found decreases to approximately 20 km average offset. With a desired displacement of 25 km, this is clearly unacceptable high. It can therefore be concluded that achieving a displaced geostationary orbit is possible, although only for a limited time. The solutions found only hold for the conditions valid around December 21, the winter solstice. Throughout the year, the conditions change considerably and become less favourable. As a result no valid solution trajectories were found during March-September. The concept of a displaced geostationary satellite solely using solar sailing as a propulsion method thus unfortunately seems infeasible.","geostationary satellites; solar sailing","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2016-02-02","Aerospace Engineering","Astrodynamics & Space Missions","","Spaceflight","",""

(mentor); Binnekamp, R. (mentor)","2016","This thesis focuses on the planning support systems (PSS) that are currently being applied in Dutch urban development practice. The use of PSS can support the complex urban development processes by giving insight into the urban processes by structuring and visualising spatial data, and also by supporting the communication and collaboration between stakeholders through interactive workshops. Nevertheless, after years of development, PSS are still scarcely applied in planning practice. One of the bottlenecks to its widespread use is the unfamiliarity of PSS to its potential users. Therefore, the aim of this research is to increase our understanding of the constraints and benefits of planning support systems; to increase our comprehension of their role in the Dutch urban development processes; and to provide insights into the different factors that influence the perceived usefulness of these applications in the decision-making process in urban development in the Netherlands. Next to a literature review, four case studies were executed using two different PSS: the MKP-MapTable of the Province of Utrecht and Urban Strategy of TNO. Additionally, the use of Tygron, Planmaat and Play the City is outlined based on semi-structured interviews with the developers to illustrate the broad variety of planning support systems. The results of these case studies have led to recommendations about the use of PSS in the urban redevelopment project Buiksloterham in Amsterdam. The outcomes are explained by using systems theory. The case studies illustrate that it still takes much preparation time to adapt PSS to the specific spatial issue. Although PSS can be used individually, the application of PSS is especially suitable for complex, integral urban development processes that are characterised by open group decision-making. PSS process explicit knowledge that can determine the feasibility of a plan, while tacit knowledge can be shared during the workshop in order to determine the desirability of a plan. PSS are not able to visualise all the effects of urban development plans, due to the complex relationships between the different elements of urban development. Therefore, PSS advise stakeholders, but stakeholders do not have to abide by the result. PSS need to become more flexible in order to deal with the new insights of stakeholders during the planning process. In Buiksloterham, PSS are especially usefull in sharing information between different stakeholders in order to create a mutual understanding and a broad support on how Buiksloterham should be developed.","planning support systems (PSS); urban development; systems theory; decision-making processes; case studies","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Architecture and The Built Environment","Management in the Built Environment","","Urban Development Management","",""

In 2050, three times the amount of land currently available on earth will be needed if the current lifestyle is maintained. Because most of urbanisation is in delta areas, and because Earth’s surface consists of 70% water, floating cities could provide a solution to this problem. Floating cities, however, require new infrastructure and transportation systems for their inhabitants. The main research question is how to facilitate passenger transportation in a floating city in a feasible way, and how to evaluate the designs of these transportation systems. With feasible it is meant whether it is possible in a technical and economic sense to construct these transportation systems and whether they are safe enough for the inhabitants. A research-by-design method is chosen for this research. This method generates insight and knowledge by studying the effects of a number of design interventions in an existing situation.(Jong and Voordt) In this report, variants of both the transportation systems and the layout of the floating city are therefore considered. The criteria, chosen for this research project, are created together with the client. These criteria include keeping the advantages of current transportation systems, improving the drawbacks of the systems and case-specific criteria. Based on these research, it can be concluded that a collective transportation system with private or small vehicles is the best option.","floating city; Transportation systems; water; personal transportation; transportation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2016-01-19","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Transport & Planning","","Transport, Infrastructure and Logistic","",""

From energy point of view, the main objective of the Smart Window was to provide ''usable'' daylight to the interior of the offices, allowing the electric lighting to be replaced by natural light and reducing the heating and cooling loads. At the same time, the proposed daylight system aimed to increase visual comfort levels, ensuring a productive and enjoyable working environment. For evaluation purposes, daylight and energy simulations were performed for different configurations and modulations of the Smart Window. The software packages of Radiance Desktop and Ecotect were used for the determination of the daylight-related performance indicators of illuminance, uniformity index and daylight factor while the energy-related ones, heating, cooling and lighting demand, as well as discomfort glare, were identified by the advanced software of Energy Plus. Two case study buildings were analyzed under two dominant daylight conditions (overcast and clear sky condition). By the application of the Smart Window firstly on an office room of the South facade of ENI Donegani Institute in Novara, Italy, and secondly on a South-west office room of the Civil Engineering main building at the campus of TU Delft, Netherlands, useful conclusions were drawn. The results of the first performance analysis of the smart window showed advantages such as better control of solar radiation, higher uniformity and light distribution but also some drawbacks. The energy performance of the building, integrated by the smart window into its envelope, is strongly dependent on the type of energy that is used to cover heating and cooling demand.","daylighting; luminescent solar concentrators; smart window","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Structural Engineering","","Building Engineering/Building Technology and Physics","",""

(mentor); De Vos, P. (mentor); Pijnen, G.J.A. (mentor); Konings, H. (mentor)","2016","The system for heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) on board of passenger related ships is one of the biggest energy consumer. The system is vital to the comfort of the crew, passengers and can improve reliability of equipment. Since fuel prices keep rising and green credentials of a ship become more important it is necessary to have insight into the efficiency of the HVAC system. When a ship designer wants to analyse the potential of energy efficient measures, other HVAC layouts or needs to evaluate how the current system will behave in off-design conditions the behaviour of the system in actual service conditions is required. Power demand varies in time due to time dependent variables like ambient conditions and internal heat loads. These aspects can be investigated through time consuming on-site measuring, but this project investigates the possibility to generate this research data by time domain simulations with an HVAC system simulation computer model. The purpose of this project is to develop a tool which provides the ship designer easy access to data of energy consumption and HVAC system behaviour in different service conditions and operational areas, in order to analyse energy efficiency in the early design stage and to gain system understanding to enable the designer to act as smart customer towards HVAC experts and suppliers. The HVAC computer model is constructed from separate component models, each describing a physical discernible part of the HVAC process. These components are verified during extensive verification procedures, to make sure the model behaves as expected. The HVAC system of the AMELS 272 superyacht, a central variable air volume (VAV) configuration with reheating, is used as a benchmark for this project. A test case consisting of one air handling unit (AHU) and two conditioned rooms with dedicated local control is built from the component models. The benchmark simulation showed that the model is able to generate data of the energy consumption and the behaviour of the HVAC system and the separate components within a matter of seconds. From this data the energy consumption of the reheaters proved to be substantial during a one day cycle for every climate. The nominal local flow rate is determined based on the worst case design conditions and because the minimum flow rate of local supply air is limited at a certain percentage of the nominal flow rate, the local supply air provides too much cooling capacity the majority of the day. Therefore a substantial amount of reheating is required. From the system understanding gained with the results from the benchmark simulation several suggestions arose for case studies to increase the efficiency and demonstrate the capabilities of the model to investigate the impact of adjustments in the HVAC system. By raising the AHU supply temperature with one degree up to 14% energy reduction can be realized, with the consequence that less dehumidification occurs in the AHU, resulting in higher indoor relative humidity. Lowering the flow rate limit proved to reduce the energy consumption with up to 9% for decreasing the limit with 5%, with the consequence that possibly insufficient air mixing is provided to have homogeneous temperature distribution throughout the room. Increasing the recirculation ratio reduced the energy consumption with up to 3% for every 5% extra recirculation air. Because of the high reheating demand a measure to lower the solar heat gain through glass did not result in energy savings. To quantify the potential of the case studies more research needs to be conducted to the boundaries of the consequences of these energy efficient measures. If the consequences are found to be unacceptable, more research can be performed to measures to cope with the consequences.","HVAC; simulations; superyacht","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2021-01-18","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Marine & Transport Technology","","Mechanical Engineering - Mechanical Systems and Integration","","52.0017, 4.3725"

Nowadays, the increasing competition is forcing the companies to conduct rigorous market researches in multiple and different stages. In this paper, we focused on building an assessment framework, which will include factors affecting the market choice for an oil and gas treatment process. We have chosen as a case study, the Thiopaq O&G technology, which is a gas sweetening process. We conducted a literature review regarding the existing macro-environmental assessment frameworks in order to extract the most interesting factors for our case study and build a new framework upon them. Then we carried out a survey by sending a questionnaire to the employees working in the O&G industry in order to understand how they rank the identified factors, which are the Political, Economic, Environmental Laws and Competition. Moreover, we attached sub-criteria to each factor in order to have a better insight and be able to rate them from the most to least important. For the data analysis, we used the Best Worst Method (BWM) that is a Multi-Criteria Decision-Making (MCDM) method, so as to have valuable and reliable results. The result of the data analysis gave as the ranking of the sub-criteria according to their significance and then we used a likert-scale to decide which country is the most promising market to sell Thiopaq O&G. According to our respondents the most important factor is Economic while Competition is ranked last, but their sub-criteria showed an interesting variation. The developed framework is a valuable tool that can be used for other products in the O&G industry, while the sub-criteria can change according to the perceptions of the one who is constructing it. Thus, it is an addition to the existing literature related to the evaluation framework of the external environment.","external factors; macro-environment; PEST; Porters five forces; multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM); best worst method (BWM); Thiopaq O&G","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Technology, Policy and Management","Economics of Technology and Innovation","","Management of Technology","",""

(mentor); Tuijthof, G.J.M. (mentor); Dankelman, J. (mentor)","2016","Ultrasound imaging is known to be non-invasive, fast, and cost-effective. However, a drawback is its reflection on bone. Therefore, an alternative acoustic wave propagating technique is being developed that eventually should be able to diagnose osteochondral defects (OCDs) that are now often missed with conventional imaging techniques. A novel technique is proposed that consists of acoustic wave propagation through the ankle joint space. The identification of OCDs is based on a presumed deviation between a reference signal (from a predicted model of the patient specific healthy ankle joint space) and a measured signal including the OCD in de ankle joint space. For the identification of OCDs, the diagnostic technique should be robust enough to cope with variation in acoustic parameters. To assess the influence of acoustic parameters, two dimensional finite-difference time-domain models of the ankle joint space were generated. A sensitivity analysis was performed to indicate the effect of variation in acoustic parameters of bone, the presence of soft tissues on acoustic wave propagation and the identification of OCDs. The minimal, maximal and mean values of the density, the Lamé’s constants, shear and bulk viscosity of bone were variated step by step. The values of acoustic bone parameters were derived from literature, those of the Achilles tendon and skin were determined experimentally. The output signals from the receiver that was placed on the outside of the ankle joint space were of main interest during present study. The output signals of the receiver in the middle and the anterior side of the ankle joint space were assessed to gain more insight in the behaviour of the acoustic waves within the ankle joint space. Variation in acoustic parameters of bone made noticeable alterations to the reference signal: variation in density resulted in normalized root mean square error (NRMSE) from 10%-16%, variation in the Lamé’s constants resulted in NRMSE from 8% -13% and variation in the bulk and shear viscosity ranged from 6% -10%. In comparison the NRMSE as a result of an OCD of 5 mm wide and 5 mm deep in the middle of the talus ranged from 5% to 7%. The receiver that was placed in the middle of the ankle joint space showed larger differences in amplitude and time shift between the healthy and defected ankle condition. The NRMSE caused by the variation in acoustic parameters of bone ranged from 1% - 10%, whereas the NRMSE caused by the presence of an OCD ranged from 10%-12%. The detectability of an OCD increases with the presence of Achilles tendon and skin. A slight difference in NRMSE and NMCC, the missing time shift and the least influence on the amplitude by the bulk and shear viscosity implies that acoustic wave propagation is less sensitive to variation in the shear and bulk viscosity than in density and Lamé’s constants. It is advised that the acoustic parameters of bone and soft tissues are estimated precisely when models of the ankle joint space for OCD identification purposes are developed.","Osteochondral defects (OCDs); acoustic wave propagatoin; sensitivity analysis; pulse echo method; density bottle method; 2d finite-difference time -domain model","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2018-12-31","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Biomedical engineering","","Medical instruments and medical safety","",""

An increasing demand for automation arises to meet with the new safety and efficiency standards. During drilling operations, drilling fluid maintenance has an important role in guaranteeing safety on the rig. Controlling the drilling fluid properties is still a man controlled process with limited actuation and measurement precision. The uncertainties and inconsistencies this brings causes major safety risk, drilling inefficiency and high costs. As the wells which are drilled are becoming deeper with each well drilled, the range in which the drilling fluid properties can fluctuate are becoming more narrow as-well. The task of controlling the drilling fluid properties is still a challenge for the most experience fluid engineers as these types of systems are typically large multi-variable non-linear plants containing internal time-delays and are subjected to input and output constraints. In this thesis, a Model Predictive Controller (MPC) application is presented to control the density and viscosity properties of an oil-based drilling fluid. A simulation model is utilized to investigate the effects of drilling on the fluid properties based on field drilling data. The thesis proceeds to show how a linear MPC application can be utilized to control the nonlinear plant, incorporating a disturbance model to account for the effect of drilling. Finally, the model-predictive control solution is compared to the current method of control in terms of closed-loop reference tracking and cost efficiency for density control.","drilling fluid; control; density; viscosity; mpc","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2021-01-01","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Delft Center for Systems and Control","","Control Engineering","",""

(mentor)","2016","Chondrocyte is the only cell type which constitutes the articular cartilage, is solely responsible for the turnover of extracellular matrix composed of proteoglycans, type II collagen and water. Chondrocytes experience a unique ionic/osmotic environment, which is attributable to the polyanionic proteoglycan, which carry a high fixed negative charge and attracts cations, (mainly sodium) into the interstitial fluid. Extracellular tonicity in healthy cartilage ranges between 350 – 450 mOsm. The osmotic environment of chondrocytes is dynamic and osmotic perturbations occur in response to loading regimen and in pathophysiology. Articular cartilage defects heal poorly and lead to catastrophic degenerative arthritis. Clinical experience has indicated that no existing medication substantially promotes the healing process and the cartilage defect requires surgical replacement, preferably with an autograft. Some models of articular cartilage regeneration have yielded good repair of cartilage defects, in animal models and clinical settings, but the overall results suggest that there is room for improvement of this technique before its routine clinical application. In this body of work, we hypothesize that the hyper-osmotic stimulus of 380 mOsm is chondro-protective, phenotype preserving and up regulates the gene expression of the critical genes necessary for the maintenance of homeostasis. To test this hypothesis we study the effect of hypo (280 mOsm) and hyper (380 mOsm) osmotic stimulus on chondrogenic markers such as COL2 and AGC1, TGF-? receptors such as ALK1 and ALK5 and members of BMP namely; BMP2 and BMP4. Additionally, we would study the effects of osmolarity on genes synthesizing the GAG molecules. Osteo-arthritic human articular cartilage is obtained from three patients undergoing TKR. The tissue is digested with collagenase to liberate to the cells. The de-differentiation experiment is performed, in which the cells are allowed to proliferate and parallelly, they are cultured in 6 well plates for seven days. The cells used would be from P0 up to P2. RNA isolation and purification, c-DNA synthesis and PCR is performed at each passage with both the osmotic conditions. The final results are tested for significance with SPSS. Chondrocytes cultured in the hyper osmotic environment, proved beneficial for the chondrocytes. The phenotype was preserved to a certain extent and also the up regulation of the aforementioned genes was observed. For the first time, sensitivity of genes responsible for synthesis of GAG molecules was established and was observed, an upregulation in those specific genes. In a nutshell, chondrocytes showed good adaptation to the hyper-osmotic stimulus. It proved beneficial because the 380 mOsm is chondron-protective as it enhances the gene expression of the critical genes and also the preservation of the phenotype is noted. This study opens up a new plethora for research with respect to osmolarity in combination with genes responsible for GAG synthesis. Targeting various critical genes, by varying osmolarity within physiological limits, would aid in engineering phenotypically stable in vitro cartilage constructs.","osmolarity; osteoarthritis; cartilage; glycosaminoglycans; transforming growth factor - beta","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2016-06-01","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","BioMechanical Engineering","","Master Biomedical Engineering/Specialization - Tissue Biomechanics and Implants","",""

Retinal images therefore provide valuable information to identify eye diseases. Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) is a 3D imaging technique that can image the retina with a resolution and depth penetration that can not be achieved by any other non-invasive imaging technique. Although OCT can achieve high resolution, in vivo measurements are severely limited by eye motion. TNO developed a low-cost eye tracker with improved eye motion tracking compared to current state of the art eye trackers. The eye tracker images the retina at a high frame rate and measures eye motion with image correlation. The eye tracker has been successfully demonstrated on a breadboard setup and should be tested on human eyes. In this thesis the eye tracker is modified for application on human eyes. The main limitation of the current eye tracker is the large reflection from the eye cornea and lens. Therefore a new optical layout is designed to cancel this reflection, while optimizing for image resolution, sensor integration time and optical exposure on the human eye. Also other modifications are integrated to increase eye tracking performance. The modified eye tracker is build and tested on a breadboard setup with an artificial eye. The modified eye tracker achieves higher tracking performance than current state of the art eye trackers.","eye tracker; retina; fundus camera; eye motion; optical coherence tomography","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2019-01-01","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Precision and Microsystems Engineering","","Mechatronic System Design","",""

(mentor); Van Zuijlen, A.H. (mentor); Florentie, L. (mentor)","2016","Turbulence plays an important role in a broad range of engineering applications. In the industry RANS simulations are a common method for predicting turbulent flow. A broad range of RANS turbulence models have been developed over the past decades. For the assessment of complex three-dimensional flow fields Reynolds Stress Transport Models are a better choice than eddy viscosity models, even though their computational cost is higher. A hybrid model that combines the accuracy of the Reynolds Stress Transport Models with the computational speed of the eddy viscosity models could be a valuable tool in the design of structures subjected to complex three-dimensional flows. Therefore the development of such a hybrid model was the objective of this thesis. A literature study on existing RANS turbulence models showed that the Reynolds Stress Transport Models (RSTM) are the most physical but also the computationally most expensive models. The linear eddy viscosity models have a reduced computational cost, but are not capable of predicting flow features that are caused by the Reynolds stress anisotropy, since these models can not account for this anisotropy. The non-linear eddy viscosity models include extra anisotropy by means of higher order terms, but the coefficients in these models are calibrated using simple benchmark test cases, making their applicability to more complex flows uncertain. The Hybrid Turbulence Model (HTM) of Basara combines a RSTM with the formulation of the linear eddy viscosity models to reduce the computation time of the simulation. This hybrid model is also unable to account for Reynolds stress anisotropy just like the linear eddy viscosity models. The development of the Generalised Hybrid Turbulence Model (GHTM) in this thesis, was motivated by this deficiency of the HTM. This novel hybrid model combines a RSTM with the general formulation of the non-linear eddy viscosity models. By using multiple base tensors additional Reynolds stress anisotropy is included. The HTM and the Improved k-epsilon model The GHTM was implemented in OpenFOAM and three test cases were investigated with this new model. The simulations with the GHTM do not reach convergence, except when the full tensor base is considered. The simulations with the Improved k-epsilon model converge and yield more physical results for the U-bend test case, showing a recirculation zone, where the standard k-epsilon model does not predict this flow feature. A mesh refinement study showed that the grid size has no influence on the performance of the GHTM. Also the use of different gradient schemes or under-relaxation did not affect the convergence of the GHTM simulations. To improve the performance of the GHTM different smoothing techniques have been tested, since peaks in the model coefficients seemed to cause the instability of the simulations. The proposed smoothing methods are modifications of the original GHTM and are therefore not useful to improve the performance of the GHTM. A closer look at the properties of the tensors used in the GHTM for statistically two-dimensional flows showed that an error in trace of the mean rate of strain tensor cause the resulting Reynolds stress anisotropy tensor to be incorrect. This problem was solved by constructing more accurate cell face velocities which correspond to the known cell face fluxes. With these new face velocities the GHTM with N=2 converges for the two-dimensional cases, but the linear GHTM still does not converge. A further investigation of the performance of the GHTM for statistically two-dimensional flows showed that in that case the GHTM with N=2 is identical to the background RSTM. This shows that the GHTM with N>1 could only lead to a reduction in computation time for three-dimensional flows.","RANS; hybrid turbulence model; Reynolds stress anisotropy; non-linear eddy viscosity; improved k-epsilon model","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","Hydraulic Engineering","",""

Microelectrodes and neural interfaces are used to obtain the information contained in the neuronal networks activity, which can be used to control neural prosthetic devices. This field has advanced rapidly and the current research is focusing on multi-channel implementation of neural interface systems to monitor the activity of a large number of neurons simultaneously. Area and safety are two main constraints in the design of neural interface electronics. The chip area constraint is important to minimize the severity of the surgery and limit the displacement of the brain caused by the implanted device. The safety constraint is critical in avoiding the damage to the brain tissue. Both constraints create a limitation on the power consumption of the neural interface system. This limited power budget needs to be utilized carefully to implement a design with low noise and high data rate with as few computational resources as possible. An efficient design allows a large number of channels to be implemented within the allowed power budget. This thesis proposes behavioral models of the electrode and the neural interface front-end, a part which precondition the neural signals before they are further processed and stored.

(mentor)","2016","A frozen orbit is an orbit chosen such that the effect of perturbations on (a combination of) the mean orbital elements is minimized. The concept first appeared in literature in 1978, and was applied that same year to the Seasat mission. This altimetry mission featured strict requirements on the accuracy of the altitude of the satellite above the sea surface. By designing an orbit for which the mean eccentricity and mean argument of periapsis remain static, the satellite’s altitude will theoretically be constant, depending only on location of the sub-satellite point. Classically, the theory behind frozen orbits is only based on the J2- and J3-term of the spherical har- monics gravity field model and clever manipulation of the Lagrange planetary equations. Through considerable analytical effort, it is possible to include all other zonal gravity field terms into the equation, but this approach is limited to perturbations that can be cast into the form of a disturbing potential. The aim of this thesis is to find a numerical method that overcomes this limit and to use that method to investigate the effects of including third-body gravity, atmospheric drag and solar radiation pressure on the mean orbital elements. To do this, the frozen orbit problem is formulated as an optimization problem. Use is made of Differential Evolution (DE) and grid searching to simulate many trajectories and to find a set of injection parameters that results in a minimal variation in the mean eccentricity and mean argument of periapsis. The mean elements are reconstructed from the osculating elements by making use of the Eckstein-Ustinov theory and subsequent numerical averaging. In combination with Precise Orbit Determination (POD) data, this reconstruction is used to investigate the variations in the mean orbital elements of ERS-2 and TOPEX/Poseidon. Subsequently, the numerical method is applied to various orbital dynamics models. When applied to zonal gravity fields, the new method is found to be in good agreement with analytical solutions. The influence of other perturbations on solutions found in zonal models is examined, and it is found that taking these perturbations into account during the optimization process does not lead to significant improvements with respect to the simple zonal case, nor does it lead to significant changes in the found injection conditions. For the assumed satellite characteristics, radiation pressure is found to be the most influential perturbation, causing fluctuations in the mean eccentricity of ±3%.","astrodynamics; frozen orbit; orbital perturbations; mission design; optimization; orbit injection","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","Space Engineering (SpE)","","Astrodynamics and Space Missions (AS)","",""

(mentor)","2016","This graduation thesis forms an inquiry into the cross-disciplinary collaborative practice in Biomedical Engineering in the Netherlands. The rationale of this study was provided by Professor Jenny Dankelman (BioMechanical Engineering, TU Delft) who indicated that she would like to gain better understanding of the collaboration process of technical experts and health care experts. Professor Dankelman’s experiences and a literature study showed that cross-disciplinary collaboration is challenging because of diverse group of disciplinary experts with differing perspectives need to develop a common working understanding in their collaborative project. To explore how these challenges took form in cross-disciplinary collaboration in Biomedical Engineering in the Netherlands, we conducted a qualitative case study of a cross-disciplinary project between a technical university and a peripheral hospital (the DORA project). The main goal was to create more awareness within team DORA of the challenges and opportunities of the collaboration process. We used Deanna D. Pennington’s framework of team actualization as a conceptual springboard to empirical investigation. She maintains that effective cross-disciplinary collaboration depends partly on a group’s capacity to value different disciplinary perspectives appropriately and to accommodate those perspectives in a shared research vision that makes full use of the diverse expertise available in the group. Team actualization represents an ideal type of situation in which cross-disciplinary experts can work autonomously but the team is effective because every expert knows how his/her fits in the shared vision that drives the team effort. The main research question of this research project was as follows: To what extent does team actualization enable participants of the DORA project in the collaboration process? To answer this research question we employed a qualitative research strategy and an inductive-deductive approach to data analysis. The concepts constituting team actualization were used as sensitizing concepts in setting up an interview guide for semi-structured interviewing. Sensitizing concepts are often used in qualitative research as springboards to investigate empirical instances. The main research method comprised 9 semi-structured interviews with key participants of the DORA project. These data were complemented by observations of interactions between participants in the DORA project at 11 meetings. We used a thematic analysis to analyze the data. This process was initially inductive of nature, which means that the first interviews were coded using ‘open’ codes that stayed close to the data. These codes were used to set up a ‘closed’ coding framework with which the remaining interviews were coded. The observational notes were used as aid in the interpretation of themes that emerged from the interview data. The findings of this study suggest that team actualization within the context of the DORA project is characterized by the following: The research vision of the technical university researchers incorporated the interests of the hospital and acted as an important driver of this collaboration. The vision was broadly supported by the team members and seemed to mediate the different perspectives that were present in this collaboration. The team of researchers and health care professionals had a contact group as the main decision-making organ. The long-standing relationships and familiarity between key members of the contact group had resulted in a firm basis of trust, which manifested itself in informal decision-making based on verbal agreements. One team member played a crucial role in safeguarding the substantive progress of the collaboration by monitoring research activities in the hospital. In this way she was pivotal to the effectiveness of team DORA’s collaboration process and therefore helped team DORA to become actualized. Based on our findings we want to raise team DORA’s awareness for the following points: Team DORA is effective in reaching their goals due to the presence of a content manager in the collaboration process. This is potentially a good strategy for effective collaboration because the team does not need to set up a very dense substantive shared vision in which all individual perspectives of team members are incorporated. Then the team should enable one member to be the manager of the collaboration process and explicitly discuss what he or she needs to make the collaboration move forward. When a content manager is elusive, team members will probably have to build a substantive shared vision for the collaboration to progress. The firm basis of trust can then be used a springboard to a substantive shared vision that integrates different disciplinary perspectives present in the collaboration. According to the points above, there are two ways for team DORA to expand their network. First, a new actor may be familiar with the common history of interaction and the long-standing relationships of team DORA. The basis of trust of team DORA will probably ensure an easy entry of the new actor into the team. Second, a new actor may be interested to join the collaboration, but not have the proper social connections with team DORA. According to our understanding of the collaborative process of team DORA, this means that the content manager will be the main entry point for the new actor. According to our knowledge, this is the first social scientific study into cross-disciplinary collaboration in Biomedical Engineering in the Netherlands. We hope that this inspires further study of the collaborative practice in this field and we recommend the following topics for future research:  What organizational structured and management styles are required for effective cross-disciplinary collaboration (in terms of reaching intended goals) in Biomedical Engineering?  How do the social relationships between different disciplinary experts in a collaboration affect communication in cross-disciplinary problem solving in Biomedical Engineering? How do individual differences in framing of the content of a collaboration (research problem, goals etc.) affect communication in cross-disciplinary problem solving in Biomedical Engineering?","cross-disciplinary; mulit-discilplinary; interdisciplinary; collaboration; trans-disciplinary; Biomedical Engineering","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Applied Sciences","Science Education and Communication","","Science Communication","",""

This feasibility study is based on the amount of downtime of a terminal due to excessive motions because of wave loading. Therefore, this study focuses on the hydrodynamic responses of such floating terminals. To be able to carry out this study, local wave data are required, which are not available. Therefore, the local climate is approximated with the wave model SWAN. The hydrodynamic assessment consists of simulations carried out in the frequency domain, using the Ansys AQWA Suite. Considered are vertical and lateral accelerations, roll and pitch motions. Motion criteria for these motions are compared with the simulation results from AQWA. The following aspects have been studied to determine their influence on the amount of downtime: the presence of a cruise vessel, wave angles, swell and wind wave scenarios and two floating terminal variants. From this study, it is concluded that all mentioned aspects do have a notable influence on the amount of downtime of a floating terminal. For both terminal models and all wave angles, heave accelerations are the limiting factor, with and without a cruise vessel next to the terminal. For these two specific floating terminals studied, the realization is only feasible in a specific cases. It is recommended to optimize both the mooring configuration and the dimensions and hull of the floating structure in an additional study. This may lead to reduction of heave accelerations, which in turn can greatly improve the potential of this concept.","Floating Cruise Terminal; Downtime; Hydrodynamics; SWAN; Ansys AQWA","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","Hydraulic Engineering","","12.1025, 68.945"

(mentor); Tsouvalas, A. (mentor)","2016","For decades, sub-sea pile driving has been performed to safely attach offshore and sub-sea infrastructure such as jackets, templates and manifolds to the supporting soil. In sub-sea pile driving, a hammer is lowered from an installation vessel and similarly descended until the (generally steel tubular) pile reaches his final penetration depth. Multiple types of driving mechanisms are used, where the mechanical impact of a heavy ram is the most common. The ram is lifted within the casing of a hammer and subsequently accelerated until it hits an anvil. This anvil spreads kinetic energy of the ram around the circumference of the pile, where the energy progresses as stress waves. Energy is radiated away from the pile in acoustic pressure and Scholte waves, elastic waves in water and soil, plastic deformation in the soil and heat. Each blow causes transverse vibrations of the pile, both due to radial expansion of longitudinal stress waves and due to misalignment between hammer and pile. If the pile is in contact with a structure such as a conductor template, it exchanges energy with this structure. Heerema Marine Contractors (HMC) conducted vibration measurements during the installation of the Britannia template, where peak accelerations rapidly increased as the pile reached its final penetration. Values up to 300 m/s2 were measured. More recently, similar conductor templates needed to be installed. Static design loads were based on these peak accelerations and the mass of the pile sleeve, which most likely causes over-designing of the templates. The aim of this thesis is to give more insight in the load transfer between pile and conductor template. Pile driving during the installation of the Britannia template is modelled, where it is attempted to validate the model with the measurements. The model describes both the pile and the template with one-dimensional vibration theories. It proved not possible to validate the model for two reasons. Insufficient quality and amount of data made it impossible to validate both sub-models independent of each other. And second; one-dimensional theories do not suffice to describe local accelerations in thick plate girders. In reality, the plate girder act as a waveguide where local variations in the motions along its height might be large. The measurement data show a large increase in the local peak acceleration, which does not necessarily imply a large acceleration of the whole cross section at once and it does not imply a large change in velocity. A follower is generally placed on top of the pile, to drive the pile up to its final penetration without causing conflict with the construction. It is likely that the presence of this follower increases the radial stiffness of the pile. A range of radial stiffness values was used to model the interaction between pile and template. The analysis showed that an increase in radial stiffness causes a large increase in the transferred force. It is therefore plausible that this is the mechanism that causes a rapid increase in accelerations as the pile reaches its final penetration.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2020-01-10","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","Offshore Engineering","",""

(mentor); Wibmer, M. (mentor); Schmidt, T. (mentor)","2016","This thesis report presents a Finite-Element based methodology for simulating wear damage in the wastegate system of automotive turbochargers. The derived simulation routine is able to reproduce the changes in geometry at contact interfaces of dynamic systems that are subject to relative motion and material ablation. The wastegate is a regulatory device that determines the boost pressure output of a turbocharger. It consists of several distinct components that are in constant relative motion due to external dynamic loads, making their contact surfaces very susceptible to material depletion. The most wear-critical location in the system is the interface between the wastegate's lever and bushing, whose cylindrical outer surfaces slide against each other due to the intended action of the wastegate's regulation actuator as well as unintended effects of exhaust gas pulsations. Severe degradation of the contact surfaces leads to significant changes in the parts' geometry, which inhibits the proper functioning of the device: It becomes increasingly difficult to achieve the optimum part configuration for the requested amount of boost pressure, which in extreme cases might result in device failure. The long-term goal at BMW's department for exhaust system development is to achieve the capability to predict the extent of wear damage at different engine operating conditions. Subject of the current thesis project is the development of a fundamental simulation routine that is able to qualitatively generate the expected geometric changes with a Finite-Element model. The most significant product of this study is a Python script that uses the commercial ABAQUS FE-solver to process the effects of an arbitrary dynamic load within a short period of time, calculate the expected geometric changes, extrapolate them to a large number of load cycles, and transfer the modified geometry back into the original analysis. The script includes three fundamental elements that are essential to any wear simulation concerned with realistic dynamic systems: 1. an accurate representation of the geometric transformation of a three-dimensional model with arbitrary spatial orientation, using a universal method for finding node-displacement directions at part boundaries, 2. a global routine to import and transfer the modified geometry between dynamic and static analyses, and 3. a sensible technique to extrapolate the impact of a load case within a short period of time to represent the effect of a large number of load cycles, such that substantial wear damage - which is typically incurred over several days or weeks - can be simulated with acceptable computation times. The implementation of the individual features have been verified numerically, and it has been shown that the overall approach itself is able to produce legitimate results if certain precautions are taken. The derived ""wear simulation tool"" can be applied to any generic FE-model with a defined load case and therefore provides a practical basis for experimental validation, feature extensions and fine-tuning.","wear; FE-Simulation; wastegate; Archard","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2021-01-11","Aerospace Engineering","Mechanics, Aerospace Structures & Materials","","","",""

The focus of this project is attracting teenagers (13 to 18 years old) to the museum, by means of an exhibition concept that offers an experience that is educational. Phase 1 - Analysis The Letterkundig Museum concerns itself with the collection of literary artefacts (such as handwritings, clippings, etc.) that are made public by means of publications and exhibitions. These should enthuse its audience and make the world behind the writer accessible. Under its wing the Kinderboekenmuseum is positioned, it tries to enthuse children to read, write and create themselves. The teenage target group is not attracted to the museum in its current set-up. The future of the museum is unclear in the sense that its location might change and the focus of the museum is about to change. Suggested is a stronger focus on digital means for the Letterkundig Museum and a stronger differentiation between the Letterkundig Museum and Kinderboekenmuseum. During this graduation these aspects remained unclear. In order to create relevance in uncertain times also solutions that lay outside the museum were evaluated. As the Letterkundig Museum focuses on literature, reading is an integral aspect of this assignment. Reading as a pastime activity is in decline among the target group, however they do have mandatory reading list they have to complete. Combined with the finding that museum visit is not intrinsically motivated among the target group. The decision is made to focus on education and an experience as part as a mandatory educational activity. Shifting the research focus to teachers as they are the deciding party. From interviews with teachers it became clear that motivating is a big aspect of literature education. Supporting the decision to make the design about motivating students and supporting teachers in doing so. Phase 2 - Conceptualisation Several directions, in and outside the museum were evaluated. From which the museum based and education based directions were deemed to have to most potential. Three concepts were developed: an overarching exhibition design, an education platform and an character based game. The concepts were evaluated and the character game concept, take over the classroom, was chosen. The concept reaches out to the target group by providing them with an experience at school. Focussing on characters, players can experience an event through the eyes of that character, changing their perspective on the story and allowing for their own personal interpretation. Selecting the characters in such a manner that the connection between characters from well known and less well known literary works can be made. Furthermore describing an overlap between the books the target group would like to read and the books the are obliged to read for school. Phase 3 - Detailing From this concept In persona emerged. In persona is a debate game in which students get introduced to a wide variety of books. The aim of In persona is to inspire students to read and helping them find the books that are suited for them. Four to five students make up a group (depending on the size of the class), each student plays a different character. The objective is to gather all relevant theme cards of the character by combining them with the right text fragments (gathered from the book). As the theme cards are not all specific to one player, some are shared among several, the players have to compete and interact with each other in order to win the cards. They can do this by finding the right arguments and making sure they get the card that belong to them the fastest. Phase 4 - Evaluation In persona offers the Letterkundig Museum the means to stay relevant in an uncertain time, attract a difficult target group and ample pportunity for further development.","exhibition concept; Letterkundig Museum; educational game; literature; education; motivating; In persona; teenagers","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Industrial Design","","Master of Science Integrated Product Design","",""

(mentor); Huijsmans, R.H.M. (mentor)","2016","Feasibility study of an alternative method for a heave compensated floatover installation. An alternative floatover method is desired to perform the installation and decommissioning projects that the Pioneering Spirit (PS), a newly built multi-purpose vessel from Allseas, is not able to operate. The alternative method focusses on platforms that the PS cannot operate due to the vessels shape. This shape causes restrictions for the width, length, water depth and air gap of the platform. The latter indicates the height of the topsides above mean seawater level. Topsides installed in West-Africa often have a small air gap, too small to be handled by the PS. An alternative method is therefore required if these topsides are to be installed or decommissioned by Allseas. The aim of this study is to investigate the possible gain in workability by implementing a heave compensation system in a conventional floatover operation. In this preliminary study the mating phase of the floatover operation is examined. The study is based on a well-documented floatover operation: the Liwan 3-1 topsides (26,300 tons) installation. The Nigerian swell sea is considered to simulate the West-African conditions. The heave compensation concept consists of three main components: hydraulic cylinders to lift the topsides, pneumatic pressure vessels to provide passive actuation and accumulators to connect the cylinders with the pressure vessels. The topsides is supported by four of these systems that are placed in a rectangular configuration on the barge. A model is developed to find the influence of the heave compensator on the hydrodynamic behaviour of the barge and topsides. The model uses a frequency domain analysis that is performed with a linear hydrodynamic model. The heave compensation systems are modelled as linear spring-damper systems. To compare the heave compensated installation and the Liwan 3-1 installation a benchmark value for the installation limit is used. This value is based on the most critical loading condition, being the horizontal impact forces on the substructure. The maximum installation velocity of the topsides is found by simplifying the substructure and leg mating units configuration, this leads to a maximum velocity of 0.4 m/s. The results of the heave compensation system are promising. The heave compensated scenario almost doubles the workability in head waves, from 46% without heave compensation to 88% with heave compensation, based on the year-round sea statistics of Nigeria. In beam sea conditions the gain is even higher, from 6% in the uncompensated scenario to 44% with the heave compensation. These workability gains are obtained using a heave compensation system with a pressure of 200 bars, 2,600 m3 of pneumatic storage and 20% of the critical damping. The dimensions of the three main elements are approximated. This leads to a system that contains 24 hydraulic cylinders, 8 accumulators and 96 pressure vessels. Combined with the deck support frame these elements weigh 9,000 tons in total and cover 46.5% of the deck area. The Liwan 3-1 operation contains a deck support frame of 4,000 tons that covers 14.8% of the deck area. The workability can thus be improved significantly in the mating stage of the operation by the use of the heave compensation system, but this would require the implementation of a larger and more complex system. However, the gain in workability might be worth this investment.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2021-01-01","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Offshore and Dredging Engineering","","Offshore and Dredging Engineering","",""

(mentor); Minnoye, A.L.M. (mentor)","2016","In the early 2000’s, the field hockey stick faced a transition from wood towards composites. Since then, the trend is to produce stiffer sticks by applying more carbon fibre to reinforce the composite. With the use of composites, sticks became lighter and stiffer, resulting in hitting the ball harder. However, the stiffer stick reduced the handling capabilities. This raises the question how the properties of the stick are related to the performance of the player. The aim of this project is to analyse how the performance of field hockey sticks is influenced by the materialisation during the design. The first part of this research is to find the relation between the performance and the stick properties. To do so, a performance index is designed based on the technical properties of the stick. The performance is defined as the balance between hitting and handling. Properties of the stick have to fulfil the performance, for which three factors are identified: stiffness, damping ratio and the coefficient of restitution. In the performance index, stiffness and the coefficient of restitution contribute to the hitting index. The handling index is affected by the damping ratio and again the coefficient of restitution. Secondly, the materialisation of the stick is investigated. Eleven prototypes were made during the project. The prototypes were made from epoxy plastic, reinforced by carbon, flax, and glass fibres, in different configurations. Carbon fibre reinforced prototypes scores highest on the hitting index and mid range on handling, whereas glass and flax fibres show better handling capabilities but are in the mid range on the hitting index. One of the downsides of using carbon fibre in hockey sticks is that vibrations occur, which are felt uncomfortably by the user. Research is done to see how the vibrations can be mitigated. Special attention is paid to the feasibility of applying flax fibres in composite sticks. Flax has high strength and stiffness capabilities compared to weight. Besides, flax has good damping characteristics. In this project, there was no relation found between the damping and the stiffness, nor with the coefficient of restitution. Also, applying a core inside, as well as applying a rubber layer on the outside, reduces the vibrations of the stick. Applying flax in a composite stick causes multiple problems. For example, the flax fibres need treatments in order to reach sufficient strength and stiffness characteristics. Also, the properties drop dramatically after a couple of wet-dry cycles. Hence, the flax fibres must not come in contact with water, which is not a feasible requirement in the current stick production. This leads to two design proposals. Firstly, improve the performance of the currently used composite sticks by adding a foam core structure. Aimed at the longer term, a new design is proposed where a plastic layer is applied on top of the composite to protect the flax from being in contact with water. The top layer could also allow for more customisation for the user by using different materials which can, for example, enhance the damping ratio of the coefficient of restitution.","hockey stick; performance; flax fibre","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Design Engineering","","Master of Science Integrated Product Design","",""

When the trainee controls the cystoscope, the supervising doctor is focussed on the scope images on a monitor. Because the supervising doctor is not holding the scope, location feedback is absent. This makes it difficult to determine whether the entire inner surface of the bladder has been inspected. This problem of missing critical parts of the surface during a cystoscopy is not described in literature, thus the prevalence of this problem is explored using a questionnaire. A possible solution has been developed, using an assistive tracking system that provides qualitative feedback on inspection performance. The result is an external tracking device consisting of sensors and a computer display that provides real-time bladder location feedback. In an experiment, participants were asked to inspect a bladder model with a cystoscope equipped with and without the system. This proved position feedback significantly increased the inspected area size during the procedure. The improvement in inspected area size was 5%. In a second study, focused on the effect of training, participants were divided into two groups, with and without the system. Participants had to perform a task six times to see the effect the system had on training. These results were inconclusive. The questionnaire that was sent and answered by 100 urologists in the Netherlands indicates that urologists find the system promising. Subsequent steps are general improvement of the system, integration with existing technology, expanding to other scope types and repeating experiments with more participants and in a clinical setting.","cystoscopy; urology; 6 DoF instrument tracking; feedback; inspection performance","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Biomedical Engineering","","Medical Instruments and Medical Safety","",""

We treat binding and typing as separate building blocks, but our approach allows language constructs – such as access of record fields – where name and type resolution are mutually dependent. By using scope graphs for name resolution, our approach supports a wide range of name binding patterns that are not easily supported in existing constraint-based approaches. We present a formal semantics for our constraint language, as well as a solver algorithm, for which we discuss soundness, termination and completeness of the solver. We evaluate our approach by expressing the static semantics of PCF and Featherweight Java with our constraints, and we implemented the solver algorithm, as well as static analysis for both languages, in the Spoofax language workbench.","Programming Languages; Static Program Analysis; Type Checking; Name Resolution; Constraint Solving","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Computer Science","","Software Technology","",""

Since Durban can be recognised by its busy port and attractive beachfront, it is a major centre for tourism. This means that research on the source of this poor water quality and the distribution of the pollution along the beachfront is of major importance for Durban to remain an attractive destination. It is very important to emphasize that to tackle the water quality problem at source technical, social and management aspect need to be considered simultaneously. It is inevitable to have a positive outcome for this project without finding a properly working combination between a technical design, the organizational structure, waste management and social issues for example since implementing a first world solution in a third world country is unrealistic at the moment. The scope area of this project consists of some catchment areas with their outfalls (of the storm water drainage system through which rainfall flows) at the beachfront of Durban between the uMgeni River and the port of Durban. Hence, an investigation of these areas onshore and a data study on the rainfall and the principle of the first flush has been performed. The first flush plays a big role in this project, since it is expexted that the first flush contains 80% of the total pollution load that enters the storm water system and hence the beachfront. The critical zones, those areas that are in urgent need of water quality improvement, are indicated by a technical analysis. Besides that a social and management analysis was carried out to identify the organisational structure of the eThekwini Municipality and present all social issues that help deteriorate the water quality and which can be disturbing when generating the final solution. Eventually, one critical zone, Addington Beach, has been elaborated on. A diversion chamber has been designed on a conceptual level that diverts almost all pollutants to the sewage system instead of the beachfront. Hence, it is expected that the sewage system and the waste water treatment plant are both capable of handling the additional volume of water due the implementation of this chamber. To increase the feasibility of this project a phasing plan has been written containing a responsibility chart and a Gantt chart. This plan has been based on both a project and process management approach.","Durban; Stormwater; KwaZulu-Natal; Blue Flag; Pollution; Beachfront; Rainfall","en","student report","TU Delft & eThekwini Municiplaity","","","","","","Campus only","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering & Construction, Management and Engineering","","","","-29.52, 31.1"

(mentor)","2016","To improve the design of soil retaining walls in narrow trenches, a design optimization tool is introduced by Hosseinzadeh and Joosse (2015). This design optimisation tool is an intensification factor on the passive earth pressure coefficient Kp, that includes the effect of overlapping passive zones. The authors argue that the passive earth pressure coefficient due to the overlap of passive zones is larger compared to the passive earth pressure coefficient in case of unrestrained passive zone development. The intensification factor XKp is defined as the ratio between the unrestrained ultimate passive capacity and the restrained ultimate passive capacity, the magnitude is dependent on the dimensions of the narrow trench. The authors observe that the intensification factor increases non-linear when the dimensions of the trench decreases. The numerical study of Hosseinzadeh and Joosse (2015) is based on theoretical assumptions of the Hardening Soil model in the Finite Element Modelling (FEM) software Plaxis 2D. To improve the understanding of the intensification effect and to validate the numerical study, a novel physical scale model is developed which models the unrestrained passive zone development and the effect due to the overlap of passive zones. To simulate realistic stress levels in the model, a geotechnical centrifuge is used where earth’s gravity is enlarged by high speed rotation of the model. Multiple sand characterization tests are performed to obtain the parameters of the Delft Centrifuge (DC) sand. Furthermore, interface characterization tests are performed to obtain the friction parameters playing a role in the physical model. Various centrifuge tests at 80g and 100g are performed in the geotechnical centrifuge facility of the Delft University of Technology. An actuator in the strongbox is connected to a stiff wall. During translation of the wall towards the soil body, the load and the wall displacement are measured. The wall represents a prototype embedded length (d) of 5 m in all the tests. Restrained passive soil behaviour is modelled symmetrically in the strongbox and the width (w) of the narrow trench is varied in the test series. An ultimate passive load is measured by the plateau state and visible by the full development of the shear band for w/d ratios of 6.4, 3.0, 2.0 and 1.5. It can be concluded from the physical model tests that the intensification effect is observed in the model results. The ultimate passive load (indicated by the plateau state) is larger in models with a smaller w/d ratio. The intensification factor displays a non-linear increasing trend for decreasing model dimensions w/d. The curvature of the trend line is similar to the trend observed in the numerical study by Hosseinzadeh and Joosse (2015). This thesis shows however discrepancies between definition and the absolute values of the intensification factor of the numerical model and the physical model. The physical model tests show significant larger ultimate passive capacities and intensification factors compared to the numerical study. When small wall displacements are compared, the restrained physical model does not show significant differences compared to the unrestrained physical model. The passive zones need to be mobilized before they can overlap. This conclusion is not made in the numerical simulation, the intensification effect is noticeable directly after the start of prescribed wall displacement. Limitations of the constitutive model and the simplified shear characteristics of the soil mass are the main reasons to explain the differences between the numerical and physical model. It is recommended to study the effect of the overlapping passive zones on sand samples with different grain size distributions and different packings. To increase the understanding of the intensification effect and to increase the applicability for engineering practice, stratification and different types of soil have to be included in further research.","passive earth pressure coefficient; sheet pile; retaining wall; overlapping passive zones; intensification factor; centrifuge modelling","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2018-01-05","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Geoscience & Engineering","","Geo-engineering","",""

(mentor); Van der Zwaag, S. (mentor); Khanbareh, H. (mentor)","2016","In recent years the number of applications relying on piezoelectric sensors has increased rapidly. New applications lead to new requirements concerning material properties and functionalities. In many of the (future) applications, such as artificial robotic skin, structural health monitoring and flexible keyboards, the necessity for flexibility and conformability of the sensor material is evident. The sensor material should be able to nicely follow the surface of complex shapes and sensing efficiency should be enhanced further. Therefore, the main goal of this project was to reduce the dielectric constant and improve flexibility and conformability of traditional di-phase flexible piezocomposites consisting of PZT particles in a dense polymeric matrix, by adding a third (gaseous) phase to the system. The presence of the gaseous component in the polymer matrix lowers its dielectric constant and increases the piezoelectric voltage constant, g33, which is the scalar measure for the touch sensitivity of the system. The focus of the optimisation in this project is on the polymer matrix phase and the (micro)structure of the particulate polymer foam composite. Lead Zirconium Titanate (PZT) with composition Pb(Zr0.52 Ti0.4)O3 was selected as the piezoceramic filler phase. Elastomeric Polyurethane (PU) was found to be the most optimal polymer matrix system, showing excellent flexibility, conformability, viscosity behaviour upon curing and processability. Another advantage of the selected PU system is the large operating temperature range, which was found to be between 0 ?C and 160 ?C. Furthermore, component A (diisocyanates) of the PU system is able to react with water, resulting in the release of CO2. Thereby the gaseous volume fraction of the foam could be fine-tuned and increased significantly. For open-mould production processes (0-3 random composites), adding 0.4 vol% demineralised water (microliter-range) to the system resulted in gaseous volume fractions of >55%, whereas closed-mould production processes (1-3 quasi-structured composites) required only 0.2 vol% demineralised water to obtain similar porosity. This indicates that approximately 50% of the total amount of CO2 formed, escapes the system in an open-mould approach. The reduction in dielectric constant was found to be proportional to the increase in gaseous volume fraction. The PZT-PU foam composites showed remarkably high g33 values up to maximum values of 95 mV.m/N for unstructured 40%PZT-PU foam and 170 mV.m/N for quasi-structured 10%PZT-PU foam, primarily resulted from the significant reduction of the dielectric constant. Note that the volume fraction of piezoceramic loading has to be corrected for the increase in total volume due to the addition of the gaseous phase. The best performing composite (1-3 10%PZT-PU) has a corrected volumetric composition of: 4.3%PZT - 39.1%PU - 56.6%air. The great performance of the new concept opens up routes for further improvement of porous piezoelectric composites and we are now one step closer to the realisation of the material that meets the (future) requirements for flexible piezoelectric sensors.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","Aerospace Structures & Materials","","Novel Aerospace Materials Group - Smart Materials Team","",""

The Optimal Feedback Control framework which models the reaching tasks, and the presence of signal dependent noise in motor commands and sensory feedback, are the mainstays of the proposed model. The driver is assumed to have acquired a noisy (experience based) internal model of system (muscles, arms, vehicle) dynamics, and has a preview of the upcoming road.

Lateral deviation (from lane center) was captured in emergency scenarios (VAF>77%), but exhibited a phase shift in routine scenarios. The Human-like steering model is limited by its Linear-Quadratic implementation, and could not incorporate non-linear vehicle dynamics, co -contraction and satisficing behaviour.

(mentor); Cidota, M.A. (mentor)","2016","The Technology in Motion project (TIM) has the goal to create an objective and non-invasive assessment method for motion disorders using novel technologies. Currently the TIM project has been looking at Augmented Reality (AR) as a potential technology for this purpose. A part of the project is to design a game that incites the patient to make the necessary movements, pushing him to the limit of his capabilities and so enabling the doctor to make the right decision. But a game is more than a set of steps to follow. A game that interests the player, engages him to participate, is a much stronger tool (Garris, Ahlers, and Driskell 2002; Dickey 2005) and will transform tedious repetition in a pleasant activity. But the target audience of this game will be patients with motion disorders who usually are older than 50, a group not often associated with gaming. This leads to the question “How can an AR game that facilitates engaging motion disorder assessment be designed?”. To answer this question, a motion disorder assessment game prototype is developed and tested to find the factors that are vital to the design. To create a game that facilitates engagement, it was decided to combine game design approaches from both serious game theories and entertainment game theories. This resulted in the game theories Rollings and Adams (2003) being integrated into the design cycle of Sebastiaan Meijer (2009). Meijer’s approach was chosen because it brings a clear, iterative structure to the process and also has space to add different design theories. For these theories, Rollings and Adams provide a clear overview of important design decisions that needs to be tuned to the target audience to create the best engagement possible. The approach of Meijer is based on determining requirements to be combined with the game design theory to create a game. These requirements are the vital factors to the game design. The game is then tested and using the results of this experiment, the requirements are improved. This cycle can continue until the game is ready to be used. To compile the initial list of requirements, two sides of the procedure were studied. First, two sessions for patients’ assessment were observed and an expert on movement sciences was consulted to determine the requirements of clinicians. Second, several patients were interviewed to determine the requirements of the target audience. These two steps resulted in the requirements that led to the concept game “Post office trouble”. In this game, the player has to sort packages in a sorting cabinet but instead of an address, the package only has an image on it that corresponds to a country. Using a Head Mounted Display (HMD) equipped with motion sensors will allow the game to track the hand movements of the player and use this as input. The player can thus use physical movements to play the game. The data from the sensors can be used as quantitative data for the motion disorder assessment. The game was tested by letting eight healthy people play a prototype of the game. Two validated questionnaires measuring usability and engagement were used in the experiment. Using the data from these questionnaires it was determined if the factors found truly lead to an engaging game. The results show that the game’s usability still needs improvement and that the engagement value is below average. These results can be explained in three different ways. The first option is that the engagement value could be true and the game is a little bit engaging. Secondly, the game is not engaging and the test participants were only interested because of the novelty of the AR technology. Third, the game was engaging but the low usability made it difficult for the participants to get into the game, resulting in the lower scores. All three options are possible so it is recommended that future research focusses on improving the usability so that an experiment with a larger sample-group can verify the results of this study.","Gaming; Augmented Reality; Engagement; Motion Disorder assessment; Game design","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Technology, Policy and Management","Multi Actor Systems","","Systems Engineering","",""

Aim of this model is to understand how pedestrians choose their routes within an urban area and to find out which quantitative environmental street factors influence their route choice behaviour. The city of Zürich was taken as a case study for a revealed preference experiment and the GPS data was collected by our colleagues of ETH Zürich as part of a bigger research program. The thesis goes through the following phases of route choice modelling: GPS data processing, Map-Matching of observed routes, Choice Set Generation of non-chosen routes, calculation of route attributes and overlap, and estimation of various route choice models.","Pedestrian Route Choice Behaviour; Route Choice Modelling; Discrete Choice Modelling; Path-Size Logit Model; GPS data; Revealed Preference","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Transport & Planning","","","",""
