An alternative to the conventional rouble mound breakwater is a berm breakwater. Berm breakwaters have mainly developed in two directions over the last couple of decades. On the one hand a dynamically stable structure, where reshaping is allowed. And on the other hand a more stable multi layered structure often referred to as Icelandic type berm breakwater. When there is a rock quarry, relatively close to the construction site, which is dedicated to the breakwater project, the Icelandic type has proven to be very attractive economically. The basic reason for that is that unlike the other types the Icelandic type utilizes the quarry 100%. This M.Sc. thesis focuses on the Icelandic type berm breakwater. Before an Icelandic type berm breakwater is constructed the stones are divided into classes depending on their size. The smaller armour stones are then placed rather deep where the influence of the wave attack is less, as well as on the rear end of the structure, while the largest stones are placed where the largest wave attack is expected. The goals of the project are the following: a) Design rules for the transaction of stone classes with depth have not yet evolved and the main goal of this project was to develop a stability criterion for the stones in that area (Primary goal). b) Stones on berm. Since the total amount of the largest stones (Class I) is usually limited, the combination of the amount of large stones on the berm and down the berm is important (Secondary goal). c) Recession. Recession will be measured in each test and thereby a large database on the subject will be made available for further research on the subject (Secondary goal). d) The location of the transition of the original and the reshaped profiles as the berm height changes as well as for different stone setups. This is also closely related to the primary goal of the project (Secondary goal). Numbers of model tests were performed in order to reach those goals.","breakwater; berm; armour; layer; stability","en","master thesis","TU Delft, Civil Engineering and Geosciences, Hydraulic Engineering","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","","","","",""

(mentor)","2008","The Markermeer is an important fresh water lake in the centre of the Netherlands. Because of its variety of functions and total scale of the lake, it is a unique area in Europe Over the years several problems have arrived in the Markermeer, which affect appropriate functioning of the lake. One of these problems is the decreasing ecological value (water quality) of the lake. This decrease in water quality is caused by a high turbidity of the water in the lake. Large amounts of mud sediment are suspended in the water column, even during normal conditions. This high turbidity has a large impact on the ecosystem. Rijkswaterstaat set up a study about several measures to decrease the high turbidity and improve the water quality of the lake. One of those measures is a deep silt trap, to catch the suspended sediment. Although some previous studies are carried out on the sediment behaviour in the Markermeer, the functioning of a silt trap is unknown. This MSc study focused on the mud dynamics in the Markermeer and the effects of a silt trap as a solution for the turbidity problem. Main question in this study is: Is a silt trap an effective measure to improve the water quality in the Markermeer? During construction of deep sand mining pits in the Markermeer, sedimentation rates in those pits were observed very high. Higher than expected from only settling of sediment from the water column. It is hypothesized that two mechanisms are responsible for the infill of the silt trap: settling of sediment from the water column and density currents. Density currents can be generated if a high sediment concentration layer exists near the lake bed and a density difference is present between two locations in the lake (for example near a silt trap). Field measurements showed that a high concentration layer (up to 800 mg/l) can exist near the bed of the Markermeer, under certain circumstances. To study the effects of a silt trap, a Delft3D model of the Markermeer is developed, which include the effect of density currents. This model showed that density currents can exists near a silt trap if the sediment concentration increases to 1 g/l near the bed. This occurs one day after a storm period. The dominant mechanism that fills the silt trap, differs for the two sediment fractions used in the model. For the fine fraction advection and settling of sediment is dominant. For the coarse fraction both mechanisms occur, although the settling process is of major importance. Also the effects of some design parameters of the trap are investigated, for example the orientation of the trap to the main flow direction (parallel and perpendicular). In both orientations a silt traps causes a reduction in concentration and an accumulation of sediment. However, a silt trap orientated perpendicular to the main flow direction has a higher efficiency. In the parallel case the trap attracts flow and causes an increase in flow velocity and turbulence intensity. This yields an increase of sediment in suspension which decreases the generation of density currents. Overall it can be concluded that a silt trap can be used as a mitigation measure for turbidity and improve the water quality. Although a silt trap will have a positive effect on the local scale, a silt trap alone will not work on the scale of the Markermeer. This is attributed to the enormous amount of fine sediment available and the extremely slow settling speed. The effect of the silt trap can be increased if it is combined with other measures to mitigate the turbidity problem.","","en","master thesis","TU Delft, Civil Engineering and Geosciences, Hydraulic Engineering","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","","","","",""

(mentor); Van der Toorn, A. (mentor); Everts, H.J. (mentor)","2008","On the morning of August 29, 2005, Hurricane Katrina struck New Orleans. A storm of Katrinas strength and intensity is expected to cause major flooding but the main portion of the destruction was caused by its exposure to failures at almost all levels of responsibility. In Katrinas wake, a Grand Plan for Louisiana is introduced by the Louisiana State University. In this thesis, the confluence of the Mississippi River Gulf Outlet (MRGO) and Gulf Intracoastal Waterway (GIWW) is analyzed. It is recommended to implement two flood protection structures in combination with a straight levee alignment between them. This option has the best high water safety and most positive ecological influence. It is concluded that closing the MRGO is the favorable option for the future development. The GIWW is highly navigated and should remain open A vertical lifting gate is chosen as optimal flood protection structure. Its hoisting system is complex but well known, providing a reliable closure system. It can also safely discharge excess water, which represents a main functional requirement. Quantifying time dependent processes leads to conclude that the optimal combination is a gate height of +30 ft (10.6 m, MSL) and leakage width of 0.05 m at the sides and 0.15 m at the bottom. This has the benefit that no perfect closure is needed during a storm event, which reduces the need for maintenance and increases the reliability of the closing process. In the design of the steel lifting gate reference is made to the Hartel Canal Barrier, a proven protection scheme in the Netherlands. The total mass of the gate amounts 1060 tonnes. The main contributors are the bottom and center lens-shaped barrier sections. The front plate forms the largest single contributor at 20% of the total mass of the gate. The upper lens-shaped barrier section requires only 40% of the steel volume needed for the leading lens-shaped sections and results in a weight reduction of 126 tonnes. Major problems due to the lifting gate vibration in vertical direction are not expected as the system is positively damped and the excitation frequency is sufficiently small compared to the first Eigen frequency.","New Orleans; hurricane protection system","en","master thesis","TU Delft, Civil Engineering and Geosciences, Hydraulic Engineering","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","","","","",""

The first stage in this is achieved by modifying the program code of an existing overwash model in development, XBeach, to enable 2DH calculations. In the second stage the hydrodynamics of the model are verified using theoretical and laboratory and field tests. In the third stage the model is validated by simulating overwash and washover on Santa Rosa Island, Florida, during Hurricane Ivan. The secondary objective of this thesis is to evaluate the effect of longshore bathymetry variations on the patterns and amount of overwash using the newly developed XBeach model. A numerical area model of part of Santa Rosa Island, Florida, is developed. The model is forced using Hurricane Ivan wave and surge conditions. The XBeach model shows five phases of morphology on the barrier island, leading from foredune erosion to breaching of the island. The model results are compared to high resolution post-storm altimetry data. It is shown that although the XBeach model produces morphological features common to overwash conditions, the amount of erosion is an order greater than the measured erosion. Sensitivity studies are carried out to determine the influence of the hydraulic boundary conditions on the final erosion profile. It is found that the model is sensitive to total surge levels and surge level gradients across the island, but insensitive to wave heights. It is shown that under inundation overwash conditions the amount of erosion and patterns of deposition are almost entirely determined by longshore bathymetry features with length scales in the order of kilometres. The primary recommendation given in this thesis is to develop and implement better sediment transport relations in XBeach and to account for effects of vegetation on the hydrodynamics and morphodynamics of the subaerial barrier island.","xbeach; overwash; dune; modelling; hurrican","en","master thesis","TU Delft, Civil Engineering and Geosciences, Hydraulic Engineering","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","","","","",""

(mentor)","2008","It is estimated that 3.5 to 12% of Dutch youngsters suffer from severe psychosocial problems: emotional or behavioural problems hampering their social functioning. A large share of this group is currently not recognised by organisations such as schools, youth care, health care or welfare. Of those youngsters who are known, not all problems are recognised. Besides, many care takers do not know of each others involvement with the same youngster, leave aside the information available or interventions taken. In this research an exploration into the most important policy considerations regarding information systems supporting the recognition of children with psychosocial problems has been carried out. The aim of such systems is twofold: to increase the number of children recognised, and to improve the comprehensiveness of those insights. The principal considerations that policy-makers at every level of government should take into account are not related to technology. Rather, institutions such as laws and regulations, the design of organisations and collaboration, and the use of policy instruments should be decided upon. The report identifies eight policy recommendations: (1) Exchange as little information as needed. (2) Consider the availability, effectiveness and desirability of interventions before collecting information. (3) Assess each system in its own right. Pay particular attention to a detailed normative analysis. No one size-fits-all solution exists. (4) When considering incident-driven systems, involve multiple professions and use a basic computer system. Decide on the type of information to exchange (contact details or limited substantial information) and the usage of risk factors. (5) When considering life-cycle-driven systems, limit the access to data to a single profession and collect substantial information. Decide on the use of expert systems and the usage of risk factors. (6) Do not exchange medical information with non-medical professions with the use of an information system. (7) Do not impose a compulsory reporting scheme for suspected child abuse or other developmental barriers, before the effect of other policy measures is clear. (8) Central government should take a stance on the desirability of risk factors, the reporting regime and a taxonomy of reporting codes.","risk signalling; risk factors; value-sensitive design; institutional design; psychosocial problems","en","master thesis","TU Delft, Technology, Policy and Management, Philosophy (Fil)","","","","","","","","Technology, Policy and Management","","","","",""

The first part (Part A0 contains mostly hand calculations for the determination of the loads and for the analysis of the sheet pile wall, while on the second part (Part B) advanced computer programs will be used for the same purpose. A parametric analysis of seven different quay walls is investigated, for various loading combinations of given loads. In details, three different depths and two different widths of the relieving platform were investigated. In addition a quay wall combined only from sheet piles, without a relieving platform is also analysed. 1)The sheet pile wall, in Part A, is analysed by three different approaching theories of Blum. The fixity of the end point of the sheet piling is considered once as completely free and in the other two as fully fixed. Graphs concerning the effect of the various dimensions of the relieving platform, the embedded depth and the anchor force are produced. 2)In the Elastic Supported Beam theory (Msheet) analysis the ground is simulated according to a more advanced model. According to that theory, the Sheet Pile Wall is schematised as a beam on an elastic foundation, where the ground is simulated by a set of uncoupled elasto-plastic springs. 3)In Part B, the Finite Elements Method. PLAXIS created from Plaxis is used for that purpose. This type of analysis is based on a model in which the behaviour of soil and structure are integrated. Through a parametric analysis and a financial assessment of a quay wall, the economic effects of the relieving platform separately on the sheet pile wall and on the whole structure is estimated.","quay wall; sheet pile wall; relieving platform; finite element method","en","master thesis","TU Delft, Civil Engineering and Geosciences, Hydraulic Engineering","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","","","","",""

For general linear and nonlinear output quantities of interest, we formulate an appropriate dual problem and derive dual-weighted Type I a posteriori error estimates. The sharpness of these estimates is demonstrated through a series of numerical experiments for physically stable as well as physically unstable test conditions in both the subsonic and supersonic regime. On the basis of the derived a posteriori error estimates, we then design and implement an adaptive algorithm capable of producing space-time meshes specifically tailored to the efficient computation of a certain target quantity of interest. Numerical results are presented, highlighting the superiority of the proposed duality-based approach over a more traditional mesh refinement algorithm employing a residual-based indicator.

Three-dimensional echocardiography surpasses the visual limitations of conventional echocar-diography, offering a three-dimensional perspective of the heart. Traditional techniques for acquiring three-dimensional echocardiographic images have been successfully applied to the transesophageal approach to echocardiography. The important clinical contribution of three-dimensional transesophageal echocardiography (3D TEE), as well as the unique diagnostic opportunities it offers, have been acknowledged. However, the applied tech-niques are based on a slow procedure, cumbersome for the patient and present certain pit-falls. Recent technological advancements have allowed more flexible approaches to 3D TEE. Such approaches are, nonetheless, based on an expensive solution with inherent limitations, available only with specialized, high-end imaging systems. The present thesis is a description of the authors work on the realization of three-dimensional transesophageal echocardiography using a TEE probe with a fast-rotating transducer array. It describes the entire endeavor of visualizing the heart and its inherent structures in three dimensions by implementing a novel approach in transesophageal echocardiographic imaging. The approach itself and subsequent research to implement and optimize it are portrayed.

To be able to design a suitable structure, the factors that influence the design have been mapped. First, an introduction to the problem and the problem definition will be given in Chapter 3. Besides that, the different goals of the thesis have been composed and added. After that, the architectural design and the vision of the architect will be described to map the requirements according to aesthetics in Chapter 4. In Chapter 5, these influence factors have been summarized in a program of requirements in which the architectural, technical and functional requirements, the boundary conditions and goals are summarized for the design. This Program of Requirements has been a guideline for the structural design and will be described in Chapter 5. Taking this PoR into account, alternatives have been designed, each with advantages and disadvantages. It came out that it is difficult to create alternative systems within the boundary conditions. These alternatives have been weighed, using an MCA to map the advantages and disadvantages, to make a choice for one alternative. This analysis will be given in Chapter 6 and Appendix 11. It came out that a curved lattice structure is the most suitable structural concept to elaborate. The alternative shape, the chance of a reduction in weight and the alternative structural concept have been the most important motivation for this choice. The curved lattice structure will be elaborated and described in the second report of the thesis. This report describes the elaboration of the chosen alternative from the first report. First, the overview of the chosen design, the curved lattice shell, will be described in chapter 3. Drawings will be added to illustrate the idea behind the design. These drawings are principle-drawings of the concept and therefore not definite. The most important drawings will be added to the main report and additional information will be given in the appendices. After that, the types of lattice structures will be described in Chapter 4. It has been chosen to try to create a space frame structure. In Chapter 5, the calculations that have been made to determine the feasibility, the possibilities, the difficulties and the structural properties of a space frame structure will be described. The goal, the setup and the conclusions of each of the calculations will be treated in the report. The elaboration of the calculations are added in the Appendices. In Chapter 6, the design will be elaborated to a more detailed level. First, the most feasible grid systems that were designed will be evaluated. This research for the most suitable system is an important part of the space frame design and was done to study the most suitable structural systems and the difficulties according the execution. The conclusions according this study can be found in the report, the complete evaluation will be given in the Appendices. In this part of the survey, it was chosen to try to create a buckled space frame. After this choice, calculations have been made, which will be described in Chapter 7, to compare the buckled shape with the hypar shaped structure. It came out that the hypar shaped structure is more efficient than the buckled shape. Another important conclusion is that the overhang could not be created within the space frame system and therefore, an additional structural system has to be used to create the overhang structure. By the search for an optimal structure for the southern hall of Rotterdam Central station, it came out that it is difficult to create an effective space frame system within the given boundary conditions. Therefore, it was chosen to create structure with an alternative configuration of trusses to give a final advice according the Southern Hall. This will be described in Chapter 8. The final part of the thesis, Chapter 9 and 10, consists of the conclusions and recommendations according the structure. The first most important result of the thesis is that a system built up with trusses is the most suitable for this case. The second conclusion is that the curved shape will reduce the weight of the structure for a spaceframe. It and can be built up using straight trusses, what is a very promising idea according to structural and executional aspects. The manual and ESA-pt calculations showed that this will reduce the weight ad deflections. Besides that, the wind loads, which are governing, are also likely to decrease. Therefore, this shape deserves additional attention of the architect. The third point is that the IGWR/ARCADIS design is a very logical structure within the given boundary conditions. An alternative for the truss orientation is given in chapter 8 and can also be created. Whether it will result in a reduction of weight of the structure is unclear until accurate calculations will be made. The last conclusion is that saving can be made for the structure, when the roof thickness or the shape can be changed.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Design and Construction","","","",""

This project consists of three modules, namely “3D Lattice Generation”, “3D Lattice Analysis” and “Interpretation of results”, the role of which are pre-processing, kernel and post-processing according to Finite Element Method. In the module “3D Lattice Generation”, a lattice of beams is generated from micro particle structure of cement paste which is one of the outcomes of the hydration model HYMOSTRUC. The following module “3D Lattice Analysis” simulates the fracture process of cement paste due to uni-axial tensile load. The last module “Interpretation of results” visualizes the results from previous step, the output of which is given in terms of load-displacement diagram and crack propagation images.","fracture simulation; 3D lattice analysis; cement paste","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Design and Construction","","","",""

(mentor); Verhagen, H.J. (mentor)","2008","Low crested structures are primarily designed as a coastal defence mechanism, making the prediction of the energy in the lee of the structure of utmost importance. As wave transmission is a measure for the energy that passes the breakwater, experiments on oblique wave transmission have previously been performed by the European project DELOS (Environmental Design of Low Crested Coastal Defence Structures) and analysed further by Van der Meer et al. From these experiments, it is unclear whether it is the roughness or the permeability of the core that determines the behaviour of the structure. Therefore, the objective of this study is to improve the understanding of oblique wave transmission through rough impermeable rubble mound submerged breakwaters by means of a 3D physical model. An experimental study is conducted based on the same set-up of DELOS but the permeability of the core of the rough structure will be varied. Finally, by comparing the data of this study with the data of DELOS and the formulations of Van der Meer et al., insight should be gained on the matter. In total, four structures are tested using irregular long crested waves; ranging from a fully permeable to a fully impermeable rough rubble mound breakwater. In order to test for oblique waves, the model is rotated progressively by 15°, ranging from 0° to 60°. Secondary effects due to the physical constraints of the wave basin are minimised by placing an additional mound of rubble between the model and the edge of the basin. This prevents a large scale circulation pattern from occurring and reduces wave diffraction effects. The directional spectral analysis software DIWASP is used to calculate the variance density spectra of the data. The wave climate is estimated with the IMLM method (Iterated Maximum Likelihood Method) because it is the most suited to portray the narrow directional spread. The aim of this study is to analyse the influence of the incident wave direction βi on the transmitted wave direction βt, the transmission coefficient Kt and the spectral changes of the transmitted spectrum. An analysis of the data shows that for rough structures there is no significant change in wave direction. The incident wave direction is approximately equal to the transmitted wave direction (βt=0.94βi for 0° ≤ βi ≤ 60°). The data of this study also show a slight increase in the transmission coefficient with increasing incident wave angle. However, when considering a combined data set, which includes the data of this study and the rough permeable data of DELOS, the data show that oblique wave attack has a negligible influence on the transmission coefficient for rough structures. The spectral changes of this study support the model proposed by Van der Meer et al. Finally, it is concluded that it is the roughness of the structure rather than the permeability of the core that determines the behaviour of the breakwater with respect to the incident wave direction.","oblique; wave transmission; submerged; rubble mound; physical 3d model","en","master thesis","TU Delft, Civil Engineering and Geosciences, Hydraulic Engineering","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","","","","",""

(mentor); Pouwelse, J. (mentor); Epema, D.H.J. (mentor)","2008","Peer-to-peer technology has produced thriving communities in which peers contribute bandwidth to each other. However, when free riding occurs, these communities will not be able to sustain themselves without incentives to enforce this contribution. This thesis presents Supervised Teaming, a peer-to-peer transfer protocol that gives uploading peers, called supervisors, control over a team of downloading peers, called team members. The team members are given an incentive to transfer data among each other, effectively reducing the upload cost of the supervisors to one piece of data while still duplicating this piece to every team member. Using transport efficiency, time efficiency, and sharing ratio as performance metrics, we prove that Supervised Teaming performs equally to BitTorrent under best-case scenarios and several factors better, depending on the chosen team size, under flash crowds and free riding scenarios. Furthermore, we have implemented a peer-to-peer client that can use both the BitTorrent protocol and a simplified version of the Supervised Teaming protocol. The experiments we have performed with this client verify that Supervised Teaming performs as expected.","free riding; supervised teaming; peer to peer; p2p","en","master thesis","TU Delft, Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science, Computer Science","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","","","","",""

(mentor)","2008","Vietnam experienced sustained economic growth over the last decades, making it one of the fastest growing economies of the world. At this moment Vietnam is still fighting its way out of poverty and trying to improve living standards. With a coastline of 3,260 kilometers many activities take place in the densely populated coastal areas. The government of Vietnam wants to use the coastal zone to its fullest potential and therefore a lot of economic development is planned in these regions. It is important to make the coastal zones safe areas for living and investments. The coastal areas of Vietnam are protected from the sea by dikes. Currently a major sea dike project investigates and upgrades the sea dikes and creates new dike construction guidelines. This project consists of several subprojects which each focus on a specific task. Subproject 4 reviews the sea dikes from Quang Ninh to Quang Nam provinces (Northern coastal provinces). The subproject 4 contents are the collection of data on sea dikes, the creation of a sea dike databank, the determination of the dike route and to set up design criteria for sea dikes. Within subproject 4 the Safety Standards project was set up focused on a plan of approach to define sea dike safety standards with a risk-based approach. Design criteria and guidelines for the construction of sea dikes are (part of) the output of subproject 4 and safety standards can form part of these design criteria. To determine these safety standards a risk assessment is executed. This is a different approach with respect to the current situation and also is a complicated subject. Introducing this new approach for the Vietnam situation the Safety Standards project is the first step in implementing this strategy for coastal defense projects. The introduction of this method in Vietnam is considered more important than finding the exact safety standards for different situations. Therefore the results of the Safety Standards project should be regarded as indicative, as an example. Translation of safety standards to technical design criteria is therefore outside the project scope. The Safety Standards project uses the coastal provinces Hai Phong and Nam Dinh as case study areas. Both provinces have approximately the same size and number of inhabitants, but different characteristics. Hai Phong is a more industrial province; Nam Dinh is a rural province. The research is focused on the Vietnamese situation and done from a Vietnamese perspective. With calculations based on economic optimalization an approach of defining safety standards was developed and three different safety standards for the Vietnamese sea dikes were found: 1. High safety level for high developed and fast developing areas; a safety standard of 1/1000 years can be considered for these areas. 2. Medium safety level for moderate populated areas with sustained economic growth; a safety standard of 1/200 years can be appropriate. 3. Low safety level for rural areas with no to little development; this can be a safety standard of 1/100 years.","sea dikes; flood risk; safety level; flood prevention","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","","",""

(mentor); Sanders, F.M. (mentor); Hoes, O. (mentor); Rood, C.P.M. (mentor)","2008","Until recently, little attention has been given to the proper reaction of authorities and population in the case of a dike breach. It is postulated that the number of victims can be reduced if all people involved know what to do and where they have to go. No technically sound evacuation plans exist for the different polders and regions of the Netherlands. This gives rise to the question to what extent current infrastructure suffices to evacuate the complete population in time from one dike-ring to the neighboring dike-rings. The central question this report tries to answer is: Which technical information is needed to improve evacuation in case of a dike breach? First, through a literature review, it is discussed how the impact of a flood can be mitigated and how, in general, floods in the Netherlands are managed. Based on this review, the need for a better supply of technical information to government and citizen is determined. A case study (Callantsoog) was undertaken to obtain insight in the impact of a flood. The case study gives insight in inundation patterns and evacuation possibilities. A number of maps containing the necessary information for the calamity organization was defined. The case study shows that total clearance times vary depending on the clearance strategy. Clearance times vary from 135 to 225 minutes. This means that, under normal circumstances, everyone can be evacuated in the available clearance time. The case study also shows that a larger width of the dike breach causes an increase in the number of victims. The number of victims differs as a function of compartment size. The smallest compartment causes 498 victims, whereas the current single large compartment causes 36 victims. The analysis of the case study led to the creation of four maps, which can support evacuation:  Inundation map with safe areas. This map provides flight possibilities to safe places within the dike ring;  Victim map, which helps authorities decide where evacuation efforts need to be concentrated;  Golf front map, which gives insight into which areas are able to be evacuated after the dike breach;  Flee route map with the times at which dike crossings, which are normally open, need to be closed. This map helps to determine along which roads one has to evacuate and how long on has before a road will be closed. Limiting the dike opening has a positive influence on risk . It reduces the number of victims, it gives more safe areas within the compartment and the time before the compartment has overflowed is extended. The current compartment at Callantsoog has an optimum size for flood risk at one dike opening. It is recommended to build no houses on locations in the compartments where the occupants do not have the possibility to evacuate horizontal or vertically preventively.","","nl","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Transport & Planning","","","",""
