The studio focuses on the future city and its densification.<br/><br/>Amsterdam has a shortage of affordable houses for starters. During the crisis Amsterdam has hardly built new dwelling projects. At the same time Amsterdam has become increasingly popular in recent years. Therefore, the demand for housing is enormous. Due to the overheated housing market, it has become almost impossible for starters to find an affordable property in Amsterdam. Also private rent has risen enormously. In addition, there is no progress in social housing. The position of the starters is getting worse and that does not benefit diversity for a 'socially healthy' city. Densification of the city and more efficient living are the solution for a future liveable city. Therefore, one must think about the efficiency of a dwelling. With the high square meters price in Amsterdam, compact apartments could be the solution to create affordable houses for starters.<br/><br/>This graduation project focuses on these affordable compact apartments and the common facilities that come with it. The project has a strong urban context in the inner city of Amsterdam, at the Groenmarkt. This is an area with a high potential with a quay along the Singelgracht and space for a new beautiful square.<br","Amsterdam; Housing; High density housing; Starters; Compact apartments; Affordability; Social design; Common facilities; Urban design; Sustainability","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","","52.371040, 4.875555"

The municipality is located in the margins of the Xingu river, affluent of the Amazon river, and has been facing intense socio economic transformations, mainly through the construction of the Belo Monte hydroelectric power plant - third biggest in the world, in generation capacity. Over the last 10 years, the local municipality estimates that the population inflated from 100.000 to 140.000 inhabitants (FOLHA, 2013), as a consequence of the jobs related to the dam and its construction. On the one hand, the implementation of the project has brought heavy investments in public infrastructure, following the compensation and mitigation guidelines established by the national environmental agency, providing the inhabitants with public amenities completely nonexistent before the dam. On the other hand, the intense transformation of the built environment resulted in new social challenges, including increased violence, prostitution and drug consumption, adding pressure on the limited infrastructure and public equipment. The project - heavily criticized by local and international media - is almost concluded and is already in partial operation. This research investigates the next steps following the conclusion of the construction, suggesting strategies capable of promoting sustainable development in the region. The focus is not only to look into the urban transformations triggered by the installation of the dam but also to explore possible future scenarios once Belo Monte is concluded.","Big Infrastructure & Influence; Regional Development; Socio- spatial transformations; Adaptive Planning; Brazilian Amazon","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","","-3.198053, -52.217587"

In order to achieve sustainable development, it has to change its focus from merely the use phase to the complete life cycle of buildings. The PD lab is an experimental platform that does so, by setting its aim to develop a modular and demountable building system that fits in a circular economy. In the spring of 2017, a prototype of the PD lab was built: the PD test lab. The cladding system that was applied, is made of an aluminium sandwich material, which is non-renewable, difficult to recycle and therefore not optimal for application in the circular economy. Biobased materials however are organic, renewable materials and might fit better in a circular economy.<br/><br/>This thesis researches the potentials of biobased materials for application as cladding material by developing a rainscreen cladding system for the PD lab. Based on a material assessment, the bio-composite material ‘Resysta’ is chosen as a starting point for the concept development. For seven aspects of the cladding system, which are: assembly, connection, horizontal joints, vertical joints, sub-construction, panel stiffness and processing technique, concepts are generated. The most suitable aspect concepts are then combined into five total concept. Initially, the total concept of extruded panels is elaborated. However, critical limitations of extrusion are encountered later on in the design process. These limitations are: open ends of the extruded panels and a processing technique which is inflexible, demands high initial investments and allows a maximum panel width of 300 milometers. Instead, the tapered panel total concept is elaborated. Based on the design problems that were found during the construction of the aluminium sandwich cladding system, special attention is given to the functions of drainage, cavity ventilation, aesthetics, assembly, space for adjustment and thermal expansion. Eventually, a biobased cladding system for the PD lab is achieved that fulfils these functions.<br/><br/>In order to bring the PD lab and its cladding system to the next level, further research is necessary on biobased materials, the development of critical cladding parts, processing techniques and the integration of the system in the circular economy.","Biobased materials; Cladding system; Product Development; Circular economy; Processing techniques","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","Product Development lab","52.0050567,4.3697138"

In case of a wind farm model, these are wind speed and wind direction. The technique sounds promising, but up till now, PCE has mainly been used as an uncertainty quantification method and not as much in order to help with optimisation problems.

Within today’s globalised urbanisation, cities seem to be better linked to the planetary system of production and trade than to their surrounding context. However, going beyond the widespread –and very popular- myth that humans act as destructive agents of the pure and delicate nature, instrumentalising the landscape to support various production models has always been the way to build human economies and societies. Today’s rupture with nature is still manifested in the antithesis between Economy and Ecology, as two opposing notions. The concept of placing humanity within natural processes [or, in the other way around, defining humans as custodians of nature’s ecological heritage] has strong supporters in the field of urbanism and landscape, and strict critics in practice. That being the case, the question is this: which are the new ecologies of the Anthropocene that could transform negative outputs of our current economic model [pollutants, waste flows] into inputs of new productive landscapes? The Dutch-Flemish Delta is used as the test bed for a new projective ecology, where pollutants causing eutrophication (nitrogen, phosphorus, CO2, algae) are captured in order to facilitate processes that generate value out of them (food production, energy) and trigger a shift in economy that will both reshape the deltaic landscape as well as set the foundations for a bio-based economy in the future. A flexible synergy between diverse components [pollution, water, existing infrastructure] is unveiled, enhancing the adaptive capacity of local economies, ecosystems and socio-spatial constructs. In the end, as pollution becomes historical, nature becomes a landscape of flows and fluids that co-exist and co-evolve.","projective ecology; remediation strategies; biobased economy; controlled eutrophication","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Since then, there is continuous and remarkable development in the HVDC technology making it an efficient way of transmitting bulk power over large distances. Due to the transition towards low carbon electricity, more renewable energy sources are being integrated into the grid. This trend has increased the use of Direct Current (DC) in the electrical networks at low voltage levels. <br/><br/>In the past few decades, space charge phenomenon in HVDC insulation have been investigated. Many techniques have been developed for studying and understanding the space charge phenomenon in the HVDC insulation. Considering the growth of DC in electrical networks, further research into these techniques and development of novel dielectric materials suitable for DC is also progressing at a quick pace.<br/><br/>Earlier studies on space charge phenomenon were performed mainly on Polyethylene, Epoxy, Polymethyl methacrylate and Polycarbonate insulation materials. These studies have indicated that the space charge starts accumulating beyond a threshold value of the electric field and has a strong dependency on temperature as well as the electric field. <br/><br/>Silicon based insulation is also known as silicones. It is a highly stable and fire-resistant fluid. It is used in cable joints, traction transformers and increasingly in compact transformers where higher than normal temperatures are expected. However, it is known that when equipment is used with DC, they are expected to suffer strongly from space charge accumulation. As a result, considerable modifications in the electric field distribution with respect to the Laplacian field occurs, especially in case of voltage polarity inversion. This may cause insulation degradation and premature breakdown. <br/><br/>The conductivity behaviour and the electric field threshold for space charge accumulation are two of the most important parameters for the design of insulation systems under DC conditions. By limiting the electric field in insulation system below the threshold value, space charge accumulation can be minimised.<br/><br/>Reusing the existing AC cable joints under DC conditions could save considerable time as well as money in realising new DC networks. For that, conductivity behaviour and electric field threshold values of the insulation material should be investigated.<br/><br/>The main goal of this thesis is to investigate and characterise silicon insulation material with regards to its conductivity behaviour and the electric field threshold for space charge formation. This study is a first step towards the feasibility of using silicon fluid-based AC cable joints under DC conditions. The silicon insulation samples in liquid as well as cured(solid) state are subjected to conduction current measurements and space charge measurements using pulsed electroacoustic method. <br/><br/>Simulations are performed on a cable joint model in COMSOL Multiphysics. Presence of cured silicon layer results in a divergent current density.

Coastal flooding due to TCs can be contributed to different types of forcing (e.g. high offshore water levels, rainfall, etc.), or multiple at the same time (i.e. compound flooding). While the impact of TCs increases, there is the need for better predictions and early warning systems (EWSs). Probabilistic forecasting by modelling different ensembles is wanted to account for uncertainties, which requires fast models. Current modelling options are static models (bathtub approach), which are fast but too simple. Furthermore there are advanced process-based models (like Delft3D, XBeach) which are accurate but too computationally expensive. The solution is the use of a semi-advanced model which solves all relevant processes, but does that in a computationally efficient way. The semi-advanced SFINCS model is developed to solve all necessary processes with computationally efficiency in mind, but is still in its development phase. <br/><br/>This research assesses how compound flooding due to TCs can be modelled in an accurate and computationally efficient way. Besides assessing the relevant physical processes, the implementation in a semi-advanced model is tested. In multiple tests it is shown that for conceptual situations a semi-advanced model can give accurate results within certain limits. Also it is shown in what conditions the advection term of the momentum balance needs to be solved and that a swash zone model approach with an indirect random forcing can give realistic results in 1D runup tests. <br/><br/>A case study of the compound flooding at Jacksonville, Florida, during Hurricane Irma (2017) shows that using a semi-advanced model, a similar accuracy compared to Delft3D can be achieved while being two orders of magnitude faster. Furthermore, a first test with wave-driven flooding in a real case study at Hernani, the Philippines, during Typhoon Haiyan (2013) shows that wave-driven processes have to be explicitly included to model all types of compound flooding. The approach to include these processes with the semi-advanced SFINCS model gives reasonable results compared to XBeach, although they can be further improved with more research. The resulting computational efficiency seems to get in the right range as needed for EWSs.<br","SFINCS; Delft3D; XBeach; Compound flooding; Tropical Cyclone; Wave-driven flooding; Typhoon Haiyan; Hurricane Irma","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","","30.304381, -81.650199"

The final design consists of a modular facade system which allows the achievement of indoor comfort throughout the year with free cooling while achieving a total energy saving of 39%.<br/>A final evaluation has been carried out to verify the overall performance, by assessing: applicability in different climates, orientations and economic feasibility. Finally, based on the knowledge collected through the research and design, some general guidelines have been given by formulating a basic stepped strategy for PCM application in facades. <br","PCM; phase change materials; Facade; translucent PCM; climate adaptive; adaptive facade; climate responsive; Building technology; Energy Efficiency; smart materials; sustainable design; Sustainability; Thermal comfort; Visual comfort; energy saving","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Building Technology | Sustainable Design","Façade and Climate Design",""

After the first steps in printing of metals and plastics have been made, research from various groups around the world is now also focusing on printing in concrete and moving to larger scales. Using this technique it will be possible to create customised concrete designs in one go at low costs and high construction speeds. Additionally, this new technology will provide opportunities to create more efficient structures. Structures can already be optimised in the early stages of the design for weight and structural performance, but the resulting optimised structures are often difficult to manufacture due to their shape. Additive manufacturing can be the key to make this possible without high costs for moulds and labour. <br/><br/>This thesis will present a novel methodology to include material and manufacturing constraints of 3D printed concrete in the optimisation process. The study examines the possibility to optimise concrete structures in the design phase. In order to save material and thus create more sustainable and more cost efficient structures, a topology optimisation tool has been created specifically for 3D printed concrete. Traditional topology optimisation methods consider isotropic and linear elastic material and will not necessarily produce realisable and reliable optimised structures. In the algorithm presented constraints of the printing process and material properties from physical testing of this layered material are both considered in the optimisation. By adopting this methodology more realistic and feasible optimal concrete structures can be designed.","Topology Optimisation; Additive Manufacturing; Concrete; 3D Printing; Optimisation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Building Engineering - Structural Design","",""

(mentor); Van de Voorde, E.E.M. (mentor); Van der Tuin, Richard (mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2018","In this thesis a model is set up to assess the economic viability of early stage buoyancy design concepts. The main research question is to find out if a versatile design approach to the buoyancy lifting concept, i.e. being able to take on multiple projects, can result in an economical viable solution for decommissioning offshore platform jackets in the North Sea. The economical viability is tested against the benchmark figure set by the current heavy lifting removal costs. From a market assessment it becomes clear that 8,190MT is the most promising size for a buoyancy device with an unknown versatility range. The minimum versatility range that the buoyancy concept of 8,190MT should achieve, is 940MT. A removal cost of 3,500 €/MT is used as a benchmark, in accordance with the Oil &amp; Gas Authorities' estimate and cost reduction milestone of 35%. Three buoyancy lifting concepts are set up using design requirements distilled from the market assessment. These are the single structure DeltaLifter concept, the double external buoyancy caissons (EBC) and a configuration of external buoyancy tanks (EBT). All three concepts are tested on their technical feasibility and the operational practicability. The methodology used in this research to assess the economic viability is to calculate the removal cost per metric tonne for every concept and compare it to the benchmark. To find the removal cost per metric tonne the initial investment costs, the job related voyage costs and the time dependent operating costs are estimated in the model. The investment costs consist of three parts; the building costs, capital costs and scrapping income. The building costs are constructed with a model of Carreyette and optimised for pontoons. Later ballast control system costs and clamping and skidding costs are added. The capital costs are omitted from this model as it is unlikely it will be financed with any form of debt. The scrapping income is modelled as the steel weight times the scrap rate per metric tonne. The DeltaLifter turns out to be the most expensive structure to build, at roughly 17 million euros. The other two concepts will costs between 10 and 12 million euros. The voyage costs are build up by multiplying the day rates of the assets required to operate a buoyancy lifted removal by the number of days offshore and adding the lump sum costs for an operation. The voyage costs lay between nine and eleven million euros per job, for the DeltaLifter and the EBT concept respectively. The fixed voyage costs are what could be expected for a buoyancy lifted removal. The running costs are higher than expected, due to the large amount of assets modelled to run an operation. The operating costs for buoyancy lifting concepts consist of two parts, i.e. the storage costs and the maintenance costs. The storage costs are modelled as quayside storage using quotes from different ports around Europe. The maintenance costs are modelled as a percentage of the investment costs. The yearly operating costs of the three concepts lie close together around 250,000 €. Finally the removal cost per metric tonne is calculated for the three buoyancy lifting concepts. It can be concluded that a versatile design approach to the buoyancy lifting concept, i.e. being able to take on multiple projects, does result in an economical viable solution. All three concepts presented in this research break even under the benchmark for multiple jacket removals. From the three concepts presented in this report, the EBC concept turns out to be the most promising concept. It is the cheapest structure to build and operationally the best concept.","decommissioning; buoyancy; economic modelling; removal cost; fixed steel jackets; offshore; concept designs","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2021-06-29","","","","","",""

The project attempts to identify these labour migrants through various narratives and historic precedents of migration in the city to form an understanding of the shortcomings of the present Metropolitan regional plan. To understand this rural-to-urban transition in the city, the research project identifies that urbanisation neglects to consider the rural landscape that it seeks to change in present day growth models and seeks to propose an alternative strategy for urban India. Review of literature on the subject indicates that rural change occurs by land acquisition and change in land-usage, rural to urban migration (transference of poverty), reduction in the agricultural production and villages reduced to slum like conditions.

(mentor); Rubino, A. (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2018","In various propulsion and power systems, modeling of non-ideal fluid flows (fluids that depart from ideal gas behaviour), presents a great challenge. For example, in organic rankine cycle (ORC) turbines, where a part of the expansion process occurs close to the vapour saturation curve, the flow deviates highly from ideal behavior. A branch of fluid dynamics called the Non-ideal compressible fluid dynamics (NICFD) deals with the modeling and analysis of such non ideal fluid flows. <br/><br/>As a consequence of the need for accurate thermo-physical property computation, various models have recently been developed for non ideal flows and a number of libraries are available to accurately predict the thermo-physical properties. However, the available thermodynamic libraries are often computationally costly since they require solving of complex equations of state (EoS) to obtain thermo-physical properties. When these libraries are coupled with existing simulation codes, (for example in computational fluid-dynamics), the simulation process is computationally inefficient.<br/>This thesis is an endeavor towards enhancing the computational efficiency of the process of thermodynamic property calculation with the use of the Look up table (LUT) approach.<br/><br/>The LUT method aims at computing thermodynamic properties of a fluid with the help of array indexing operations applied on pre calculated or existing thermodynamic tables. These tables are initially obtained from a thermodynamic library FluidProp. A binary search algorithm helps in accurately locating the query point(s) on the thermodynamic domain. A data interpolation algorithm is then used to predict the thermodynamic properties of interest. The presented LUT method ensures inherently high accuracy with a very small computational cost, as demonstrated later in the thesis.<br/><br/>To check the applicability of the LUT method, it is used to obtain the pressure variation across a control volume with subsonic flow conditions. As a second and a much larger application, the LUT tool is coupled with an in house MOC (Method of Characteristics) tool to design the geometry of a supersonic nozzle. <br/><br/>A comprehensive analysis of this method is presented by comparing the accuracies and computational cost with the results from FluidProp. Both interpolation methods implemented in the proposed LUT method prove to be computationally efficient and accurate. The method is successfully applied to the MOC tool to design the geometry of the diverging section of a supersonic nozzle.<br","Look up tables; thermo-physical properties; interpolation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

However, there has been concern about introducing daylight to sports halls since the design of traditional sports halls has tended to exclude natural light. If one looks at the vast majority of sports halls in the Netherlands where gymnastics is given at primary schools, the sports hall often totally relies on artificial lighting to provide a glare and shadow-free environment. This means that all the benefits of natural light have had to be eliminated. Nevertheless, it is important to see how daylight can be an integral part of the design of a sports facility, because daylight is essential for the health of human beings. This research assesses the arguments facing traditional sports hall designs, to identify whether more contemporary and creative approaches to the design of naturally lit, energy efficient, modern and safe sports hall designs can be made widely obtainable. With this inquiry alternatives are found where daylight is an integral part of the sports halls instead of using only artificial light in order to meet the technical requirements.

Whendesigning a load-bearing column, fireresistance is a significant part of theoverall safety of the column.Columns that are made out of glasscan be separated in five types byNijsse, R. &amp; Ten Brincke (2014); profiled,layered tubular, stacked sheets,bundled and cast. As far as we know,the profiled glass column is thy onlytype that is used in the structure in abuilding so far. When wanting to producea cast glass column, this columnshould be split up into smaller pieces.This is because it would result in anannealing time that is much shorterdue to the smaller dimensions andvolume of the different parts of thecolumn.When the column is split up intopieces, thoughts should be about howto connect those separated pieces.Previously in cast glass structures inthe Atocha Memorial in Madrid andthe Crystal Houses in Amsterdam, anadhesive glue was used to bond thebricks. In these structures it is notpossible to remove the glue easily;which will eventually result in moreresidual waste with no recycled glass.When a dry connection would be chosen,the column could be re-stackableand recyclable. Because the columnshould also be able to hold shearforces, this dry connection should besubstantiated with a shear connection.This connection could be constructedby an interlocking surface or element.In this design, this connection is madewith a dry interlayer of TPU and aninterlocking sphere between the surfaces.This interlocking sphere only had tobear the shear forces that will be appliedon the column. These forces willbe much lower than the compressiveforces that will be transferred throughthe flat surface of the components.This is why there will be great freedomin the materials and the interlayersthat may, or may not be used.A list of design principles and challengeshas been made during the literatureresearch that has been done. Fromthis different designs have been madefor the component design. An elegantbone-like shape has been chosen todevelop further, to find the limitationsof glass as a material and the loads ithas to carry.In this design, ten subcolumns ofconstructed of the same componentand its interlocking sphere will be thestructure of the total column. Due tothe forces that are applied in the casestudy the glasspalace, a building ofmultiple stories on the ground floorthat has a height of 6 meter, the componentand therefore the column grewvery big and robust.Different mock-ups on scale 1:3 aremade with the silicone moulds thatare produced; ice, sugar glass, glassand epoxy. Some were experimentallytested on strength and cracking behaviourin comparison to real glass.This thesis aims to find out how wecan design and produce a safe, engineeringsound, re-stackable, free-standingcolumn made of multifunctionalcast glass interlocking components.","cast glass; dry connection; interlayer; interlocking geometry; Multifunctionality; glass column","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The Usher Syndrome is a hereditary disorder, where people's sight and hearing degenerates over time. As a result, being socially involved with other people can be challenging, especially in rooms that are low-lit and that include background noise. The project was initiated to help people with Usher Syndrome to still be able to socially involved, regardless of such challenges. Hence, the project assignment is stated:<br/><br/>“To design a non-stigmatizing, portable and affordable product for people with Usher syndrome, that offers enhanced control over lighting and/or acoustics, with the goal of improving their sense of involvement in social contexts.”<br/><br/>Methods<br/>Methods used in tackling this assignment are the classic design cycle by Roozenburg and Eekels, accompanied by the diamond model of Buijs. The design cycle entails evey step of the innovation process where in every step - by using the diamond model - information is gathered (diverging) and narrowed down subsequently (converging), steering many options to a single defined design outcome. Important steps are evaluating ideas and validating concepts with end-users, to ensure a meaningful product is realized.<br/><br/>Results. As a result of the deficits caused by Usher, having conversations with other people can be challenging. Especially, in a dark and noisy context like a bar or pub: the design context in this project. In understanding a conversation, speech contains the most information. By aiding the sense of hearing, speech intelligibility can be improved and in turn the sense of social involvement. Important functions to for a design for people with Usher is this context is separating speech from background noise, reducing the distance between the speech source and person with Usher, allow volume control over the speech source and enable a connection with the hearing aid(s) and/or cochlear implant(s) of the person with Usher. Current products do not offer such functionalities. <br/><br/>Functions and requirements are ultimately translated into a design proposal: a microphone system called Micall. Micall is a system of small microphones that can be divided among friends/family. These Mics can pickup sounds from each person individually rather than capturing an entire scene like current microphone aids do. Speech is now separated from background noise and is made more intelligible. Feedback received from validation tests shows that the project assignment is validated: Micall is a non-stigmatising, portable product with enhanced control over acoustics and improving sense of involvement in social contexts.<br/><br/>Conclusions. After a full design project has been performed, a solution is found to the project assignment: Micall.<br/>Micall proves to assess the main functionalities as stated in the project assignment by the validation of the end-users.<br/><br/>Discussion. A realisable design proposal is made, which can be developed in the near-future. However, more focus is needed on the sound engineering and manufacturing sides. With more advanced models deeper use insights can be gained. Also, investment models should be researched in order to come up with viable ways of developing, producing and selling the product.","Usher; Assistive technology; hearing impaired","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","","","","Integrated Product Design","",""

The Dutch natural landscape has now changed into a cultural landscape under control. This project explores the potential of cultural landscape in terms of boosting the economy by recreation and recovering the ecology.

The result is a biography of the changing landscape, that runs from the Rome times to the present-day, and that focuses on the study of the interrelationships between spatial transformations, social and economic changes and the construction of regional and local identities in the region. This approach also offers interesting possibilities for applications in the sphere of heritage management, landscape design and spatial planning. Learnings from theories and practices with context analysis, at the regional scale, it is possible to propose the operative landscape structures as the spatial framework for the future development of Eco-tourism.<br/><br/>Based on this spatial framework, strategies for transformation are introduced for Browersdam and its surrounding village. Then based on the typology of this spatial framework, several zoom-in sites will be selected to demonstrate possibilities and potentials through design intervention for integrating water infrastructure with spaces of local habitation and activities. To support the proposals with better feasibility, the project phasing and institutional framework will also be proposed, identifying the priority and potential actors in the process.<br/><br/>With reflections on the contribution to the fields and evaluation of influences, the thesis expects to provide a showcase with methodology, strategic tools, and spatial possibilities integrating different cases of interaction between human activities and river environment.

This thesis is devoted to find the cause, to prevent this from happening in future operations. First off a literature study and analysis of the environmental conditions is carried out. A study in the mechanical behaviour of the system will provide a good perspective on the situation. Finally, the cause is verified with model tests and a numerical model is validated. <br/>From the environmental conditions wind and current are expelled as (main) contributor. Data analysis and system analysis conclude that waves are the main cause for the problem. In the model tests this cause is validated together with the mechanical behaviour (natural frequency) of the system. The natural frequency of the monopile is depending on the waterlevel. <br/>Wave frequencies (in the spectrum) close to the natural frequency cause a resonance phenomenon, with large monopile motions as consequence. <br/>A numerical model, based on a mechanical system and the Morison's equation is validated. The numerical model is a good and fast solution for modeling monopile motions, from wave conditions.

Specifically, this project is about intervening on two Structuralist buildings, PN van Eyckhof and Matthias de Vrieshof designed by Joop van Stigt in 1982; the brief calls for their regeneration and adaptation in today’s society, while focusing on one of the two clusters. Although the buildings do not fulfil the criteria to be considered as monuments they have a significant value due to the movement they represent, making their preservation an obligation for our generation’s architects. Starting of through an analysis at the scale of the city, context and buildings, allowed me to understand the architect’s original intentions and investigate which of these were actually realised. Through this analysis I found the architect’s initial ambition of creating an open building that would be linked to its context, to be the most intriguing aspect. Those bold differences between the architect’s ambitions and the realized proposal were also the ones that defined my project’s research question, “How can I re-link the cluster’s buildings with each other, the university as a whole and with the wider context, Leiden and its inhabitants?”. My intervention’s aim is to fulfil the architect’s ambitions; achieving this aim could be done using two types of interventions, programmatic and architectural. Regarding the Programmatic Interventions, following the tendency of educational facilities to be associated with the professional environment from early stages, the introduction of an entrepreneurial hub to the university, would become an innovation for the University of Leiden, giving a new essence and spirit to it Leiden and engage it with the society of Leiden. A series of well-considered architectural interventions, including the replacement of the original top floor, glazing of the courtyard, introduction of the tower, and others, have resulted to a project which fulfils my initial aims, respects the existing building and is a contemporary translation of van Stigt’s design. Talking about the value of my proposal for specifically the Humanities faculty and its context, through my proposal my aim is to positively affect the development and regeneration of the university and its context though programmatic and architectural (form &amp; image) alternations, strengthening the Humanities Buildings’ position both in the university and the wider context. That being said, throughout any decision I took during the design process, my aim was to always respect van Stigt’s ambitions and values in his building and at the same time consider how users currently experience the building and what are their needs. Looking back at my proposal and reflecting to its quality both in programmatic and architectural language terms, I believe that my intention to respectfully adapt my proposal to the original design, and at the same time giving a new essence and revitalizing the historic composition and its context, has been achieved. Through my proposal, I have managed to show that despite being hard to intervene on such historic buildings due to all problems that underlie them, a deep preliminary study, together with concrete reasons for every decision an architect takes considering the values of the existing composition, can lead to innovative ideas and results, showing new ways to intervene on Structuralist monuments","Heritage & Architecture; Heritage; Structuralism; Joop van Stigt; Monument; Leiden University; Hummanities Campus; Architecture; Architectural engineering; architecture-based design; Building technology; revitalisation; Renovation; extension; Heritage and Architecture","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","","52.156911, 4.481836"

Eulerian studies have shown that with increased Arctic precipitation AMOC (Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation) strength decreases. Decrease in AMOC strength comes with a decreased redistribution of heat from lower to higher latitudes which can have severe effects on our climate. Therefore, understanding the effects and mechanisms of Arctic precipitation change is a crucial building block for predicting and possibly preventing climate change. This study used a Lagrangian approach. The pathways of water at Fram Strait were investigated for present-day climate (control run) and two scenario runs with increased Arctic precipitation (+50% and +300% respectively). Importantly, it was found that Arctic water reaches the Labrador Sea through Denmark Strait for all three runs. Thus, the extra fresh water in the Arctic can possibly impact sinking and convection zones in the Labrador Sea. The total amount of Arctic water, passing Denmark Strait from Fram Strait, increases for the weak scenario and decreases for the strong scenario of this study. On the other side of Iceland, for the strong scenario of this study, Arctic water stops passing the Iceland-Faroe-Ridge through the Faroe Bank Channel. The amount of Arctic water going into and staying in the Nordic Seas remained almost unchanged with increased Arctic precipitation. The two routes passing from Fram Strait into the North Atlantic were analysed further with respect to depth changes and properties. On both routes particles were fresher compared to the control run when increasing Arctic precipitation. For the weak scenario particles were usually colder than the control run on both routes. For the strong scenario, particles were only colder at Fram Strait, but got warmer than the control run along the pathway.","Climate Change; Arctic precipitation change; AMOC; Langrangian approach","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The 3000-year-old Temple shrine at Kedarnath survived the major event without any damage. The unchecked tourism and unregulated urban sprawl of the valley aggravated the calamity to an apocalypse causing severe damage to infrastructure and completely uprooting the genius loci of the religious landscape of the valley. Therefore, this thesis aims to organize and restructure the valley in order to carve spaces within the fragile landscape while preserving its sacred aura. The dynamic processes of sedimentation and erosion were tapped to strengthen the landscape. The seasonal economy was also a major challenge and therefore the design includes community participation in the construction process as well.

But it has become very clear that today’s degree of car use is not sustainable in terms of land and energy use and emissions. Big developments are about to shake up the automotive world, but they do not bring the change that is needed. A traffic jam of electric vehicles is still a traffic jam. Autonomous cars are about to increase the attractiveness of cars and mobility services are mainly competitive with public transport. Many regulations and projects aim to decrease car use and car ownership. But most of them try to address people’s reason by focussing on instrumental motives only. Instead, triggering people’s emotion by means of symbolic affective motives is much more efficient. In this project it is decided to focus on cultural values. Values are strongly tied to emotion and are the most important drivers for people’s behaviour. This design project works with the ViP (Vision in Product Design) design method as guidance, and uses other design and design research methods as input. First, the values of the future user (Mercedes-Benz drivers) are being researched using a qualitative method (Context Mapping) complemented by a quantitative method (Short Schwartz Values Survey). Values most important to Mercedes-Benz drivers are Self-Direction, Security and Benevolence. With the future user in mind and after constructing a future context, a mission statement is formulated: “In a world where AI is valued over human instinct/feelings and urban areas are confronted with severe consequences of climate change, we want MB drivers to embrace travelling with their peers, using sustainable mobility alternatives. In order for them to do so, we need to make sure MB drivers feel their sovereignty is respected, and they feel secure in the changes they are making.” The concept presented in this report is a platform where members form clubs through which they have unlimited access to premium mobility. The most important value propositions of the service are: ‘Unlimited access to premium mobility’, ‘Travel with people you’ve always wanted to meet’, ‘Choosing your own club, feeling at home in your club’, ‘Perform your desired activity’, ‘Growing as a member’, ‘Join in adventure’. The concept was validated by means of presenting the concept as it was ‘already there’, in a folder to do face to face interviews and on a website for an online survey. The in total 65 participants rated the service a 4,3 out of 7. Mercedes-Benz drivers rated the service on average a 3,8 out of 7. Participants were also asked to rate the value propositions of the service. The value propositions that were rated highest all found their roots in the values Self-direction and Security.","Cultural values; Urban mobility; Future cities; Future Context; Value driven design; Mobility; Mobility service; platform; Service design; Product design","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","","","","Integrated Product Design","",""

At first, a literature study was performed in order to set the basis for further research. A context mapping session was performed with both men and women to get a sense of the dreams and values older people have regarding intimacy and sexuality. By using the output of the research phase, a multitude of ideas was generated. In order to test the effect of the concepts, two evolution tests were performed. In these tests, audio was discovered as a medium to evoke specific emotions and feelings. Based upon these insights a design goal was defined: “I want to design an audio experience that stimulates the fantasy of elderly women through which they can explore their sexual identity. The intended experience is defined as intimate, ambiguous and dreamy.” The final design Tintelzinnen is an application that consists of different audio stories the user can listen to, to explore various aspects of her sexual identity. Each storyline answers to a different form of intimacy. Through this, the listener can discover how she relates towards the different aspects of intimacy. One audio story is written and recorded. It is designed to both immerse the listener into the story, while at the same time giving space to the listener to fill in the details by using their imagination and memories. The application is designed using ambiguous illustrations to immerse the listener into the audio experience and to guide the user into an attentive listening position. To evaluate both the audio story and the browsing experience of the application a prototype was built. This prototype was evaluated with three participants, all women around the age of 70. Each participant experienced listening to the story differently. The prototype evoked different feelings and memories based upon the background of the participant. The audio story had the right balance between immersion and interpretation of the listener. Browsing through the screens of the application was experienced as a dreamy and the ambiguous illustration of the audio story contributed to the listening experience. Other insights serve as recommendations. More testing is needed in the future to understand the impact of the design on an older person’s sexual development.<br","intimacy; elderly; imagination; audio; sexuality","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","","","","","",""

The SLO defined digital literacy with the following four elements: ICT basic skills, computational thinking, information skills and media awareness. Computational thinking, frequently taught through programming lessons, is often considered to be the most challenging component of digital literacy. Despite all the work around planning and curriculum building, it is important that teachers’ perspective, their involvement and professional development is thoroughly investigated and prepared to let them teach the concepts of computational thinking (CT) with confidence. With a limited amount of research focusing on teachers, this study aimed at identifying the needs for teachers who are getting started teaching the concepts of CT. In the first part of the study examination of teachers’ TPACK took place via semi-structured interviews. Assessment of learning was identified as a major challenge/need. Teachers expressed not being able to measure how much and what a pupil has learned about CT-concepts and primarily used computer-based practical assignments as an assessment tool in a formative way. In the second part of the study a lead-up survey was created to gain more insight about the used CT assessment tools and teachers’ attitude towards CT assessment. To test whether attitude towards assessment and assessment tool suitability was different for programming lessons, respondents were asked to rate statements and assessment tool suitability within three different contexts (i.e. education in general, their own subject and programming lessons). Despite a noticeable decrease in summative score and an increase in formative score for programming lessons, no statistically significant difference was found across the three contexts when measuring latent variables for formative and summative assessment. However, several statistically significant differences were found measuring the suitability of assessment tools. In terms of programming lessons, teachers rated not practical and not computer-based assessment tools significantly lower in suitability while a set of small practical computer-based assignments were rated significantly higher in suitability. Future research can focus on examining teachers’ arguments with regard to the suitability scores that they have given and measuring attitude towards assessment for programming in general.","computational thinking; ct; assessment; programming; tpack; digital literacy","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This project focusses on the city living of Amsterdam, where high density and future orientation are very important.<br/><br/>There is an increasing amount of young families that leave the big cities. In this Amsterdam has the highest number of all cities in the Netherlands. The main reason for leaving is the extension of the family (or plan to), which results in new requirements for the house and living environment. Most families want to stay in the city but can’t find a house that meets the new requirements. They look for more space, a safe environment for children to play and for an affordable price. This is not possible in the housing market of Amsterdam. <br/><br/>To provide a living environment for these young families in Amsterdam the research reviewed the needs of young families and investigated which design solutions could satisfy them on the scale of the neighbourhood, building and dwelling. These design solutions are obtained from literature and six case studies and combined in a scheme. The main aspects that are important for the living environment of young families are: safety, facilities, playing and interaction, supervision, space and identity. All the design solutions are divided into these aspects. <br/><br/>A personal choice of some of the design solutions from the six topics provide the focus of the design. The design creates affordable housing and a safe living environment in the city center of Amsterdam, on the Tweede Weteringsplantsoen. To provide this the design expends the living space of the residents towards the collective space of the building. This consists out of a court-like raised square and a new street level on the fourth floor of the complex with a gallery and small squares. These open spaces at the top provide the characteristic form of the building and a strong identity. The dwellings are orientated towards the collective spaces of the building, to allow for supervision of the children playing outside. Children of different ages can slowly expend their range of action from the safety of the shared spaces of the building towards the city. The layout of the dwellings provides flexible use of the rooms and the possibility to create more rooms.","Housing; Amsterdam; High density housing; Urban families; Young families","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","","52.358903, 4.892447"

Exploring Nairobi as a city of arrival, my personal process in the development of this project was quite similar to that of coming to Nairobi as a migrant, continuously learning to understand, use and finally appropriate the city.<br/>As a colonial foundation closed off to the native population, Nairobi, the urban epicentre for East Africa, has always been a city of constant coming and going rather than a point of identification for the Kenyan population. By consequence, Nairobi’s metropolitan system in general and its public space in particular is optimized to flexibly absorb the masses of migrants that make up its population. However, the lack of codification of public space, its dynamics and use side-lines minorities and arrivals and inhibits the ‘becoming’ of Nairobians, disenfranchising them with their own city.This research will therefore commence by trying to get an understanding of how Nairobi has developed into a city of comings and goings over the past 100 years since its foundation. Exploring the historical development of the city and its residents, I will argue that the notion of public realm in Nairobi is radically different from the ideals of public space discussed in traditional planning practice, mostly reflecting the European city.I will in a second step systematically analyse the spatial dimension of the public realm in Nairobi coming to the conclusion that in spite of its illegibility to arrivals, the city works by a set of clear spatial rules.<br/>Based on this research, I will try to establish how digitalisation and the mobile economy will codify the dynamics of public space and life in Nairobi. Trying to mediate between the city’s duality between integration and identity, this project will then propose a framework of soft and hard public spaces based on existing structural and spatial typologies found along Nairobi’s Ngong Road. Using a set of site specific indicators, these elements will be synthesised in designs for key sections of Ngong Road and its vicinity.","Kenya; Nairobi; African Urbanism; Urban Design; Public Space; Design As Politics","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","Design As Politics","-1.299007, 36.761463"

Currently more than half of the world’s population live in cities which results in the rise of the human footprint, affecting the local climate. Simultaneously the planet’s climate is changing towards less predictable weather conditions with high extremes, e.g., heavy rainfalls, followed by long dry periods or severe heatwaves. Frequently extreme weather conditions are associated with flooding and hurricanes, while heatwaves represent an equally important danger for the health of city’s citizens. <br/>UHI has been recognized as one of the leading environmental issues of the 21st century. The UHI is defined as the area within a city with the higher surface or air temperatures compared to its surroundings. The higher urban temperatures are resulting in health-related issues among the population, greater energy demands, and various economic losses. Thus, the current work is focusing on researching the air temperatures in the urban canopy layer, which are mainly affected by the heat radiated from the urban surfaces during the night. Moreover, there are differences in the heat exchange phases between the neighborhoods, which are caused by the heterogenicity of the morphological characteristics of the city. Such information can be of great use for the development of UHI mitigation strategies, but it is currently very sparse or not detailed enough. Therefore this master thesis investigates the possibility for generation of more detailed models, taking into account the intraurban variability. For the development of the statistical models explaining the UHI effect in the city of the Hague different spatial and sensor datasets have been used. The data about the temperatures in the city for 2017 have been collected with the means of the Netatmo weather stations. Additionally, different spatial representations and their effect on the statistical analysis have been investigated. In combination with the different spatial models, six distinct UHI contributing factors have been researched, namely the Buildings density, the Land cover index, the Vegetation index, the Sky View Factor, the Non-permeable surfaces in the city and the Vehicle traffic density. These variables have been calculated and utilized in the statistical analysis of their relationship with the air temperatures in the Hague. The results indicated a weak relationship between the air temperatures and the different spatial characteristics of the city where only the Sky View Factor and the Non-permeable surfaces proved to be statistically significant variables.","Urban Heat Island; Geographically weighted regression; Modelling","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Geomatics","",""

By using Leiden Humanity Faculty designed by Joop van Stigt (1976) as a case study, the researches were conducted through various perspectives which range from architectural/urban design strategies, techniques, and limitations. Those studies were aimed to provide an essences transformation frameworks and intervention strategies for the future alteration of this university campus. The relationship between research and design will be illustrated through both significant tangible and intangible perspectives. In fact, a further elaboration on the intangible aspects analysis is very crucial for this graduation studio. Since the structuralism movement was originated by the humanity ambitions, critical assessments on the design philosophies will gradually lead to a set of logical approaches which influence the intervention decisions and offering guidance to all aspects of the adaptive reuse scheme. The synthesis of the collective information will be a key to the appropriate framework of structuralism architectures protection. In addition to the architectural adaptive reuse, this redevelopment project is also aimed to be a prototype for the later development of the study procedure at Leiden University. Throughout the four centuries, this university has mainly relied on the text-based research methodologies. Literature and written document investigations have been introduced as the preliminary devices of the study here. This method has always been a reliable information for some specific field of researches. In contrast, this authentic methodological approach may not be fully applicable in the fast-changing society in the current situations, especially in the art and cultural studies. Taking these thoughts into consideration, the new approaches to the study procedure at Leiden University will be set as another ambition of this graduation project. Also included are the critique and reflection on the original Van Stigt’s Humanities Faculty buildings and Dutch Structuralism Movement on various scales. While preserving the cultural values of this architectural movement, this graduation project was also aimed to challenge preconceptions about heritage architecture adaptive reuse. One of the most appropriate schemes was selected and elaborated in details as shown in the chapter-""Strategies &amp; Design Proposals"" of this graduation report.","Heritage & Architecture; Structuralism Architecture; Academic Building; Joop van Stigt","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Heritage & Architecture","Redevelopmet of Leiden Witte Singel Doelencomplex",""

However, in the case of India’s capital city of Delhi with 73% of its population living in these settlements, the discipline has been forced to re-position itself. Forming outside the claims of regulation and planning, the sheer existence of these settlements challenges the city’s aspiration to become a ‘world city’. Resultant, is a love-hate dynamic where a high-modernist design propaganda seeks to evict the urban poor’s position in the city to a ‘safe’ distance where they are out of sight but in the appropriate range to aid the city function.<br/><br/>I base my study in ‘Anand Parbat’,a deplorable resettlement transit neighbourhood developed 4 miles from the city core to re-house slum dwellers evicted from inner city areas. Envisioned as a transition camp, it is home to more than 2000 families. The design of the ‘camp’, involved a process of ‘formalizing’ the informal and invited disciplinarian aid, which by the virtue of ‘always being outside the system’ was exceedingly limited in the understanding and translational of the emergent qualities of a user-generated informal dwelling. With rigid dwelling typologies, unregulated open/shared space structure and an incoherent application of ‘incrementality’, Anand Parbat is an architectural mess.<br/><br/>This thesis attempts an iteration to existing approaches by offering an alternative housing scheme. It learns from the contextual informality and rationalises the learnings for a disciplinarian application. It uses infrastructure as invisible layers as the backbone of the dwelling layout and reimagines domestic space for rendering progressive and high-spirited families. By the means of economics, proactive policies and careful design decisions it lays out an itertive and nuanced masterplan scheme that beneath its surface offers various spatial characteristics of an informal settlement from Delhi. <br/><br/>The project peaks at building and surface material innovation where to make the dwellings cost effective a brick is modelled out of kitchen waste found commonly in Indian urban poor kitchens. A large variety of colors and sizes are innovated to give the settlement an aesthetical character. Various cost effective techniques are used to involve inhabitants into small-scale buidling processes.<br/><br/>The project is rationalised for a widespread application in New Delhi, fully capable to absorb and embody contextual characters - geographic, cultural and economical. The project is also visualised for projective iterations and scenarios that would be cast by its inhabitants to highlight the performance of the design decisions in time.","Affordable Dwelling; Material Innovation; Urban Informality; Community building; New Delhi","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Explorelab","","28.664941, 77.174777"

Since the Industrial Revolution,people and cities have become more dependent on cars, and by the mid-20th century, infrastructure moved toward being a component of trafficmanagement, instead of urbanism. In urban situation, this caused barriers andisolated spaces, breaking up the fine grained pedestrian network. The cardependent city has serious consequences for health, social connectednessand the environment.In the research location Toronto, large infrastructural elements are imposingthemselves as a barrier between the city and the waterfront. In order toreconnect the city to its Waterfront, streets need to be rediscovered as socialspace and the balance between a street as ‘movement space; and ‘socialspace’ has to be restored. ‘Walkability‘ is the key. A theoretical framework on‘Access &amp; Linkage’ and ‘Placemaking’ will support the design for a succesfulpedestrian network in the city.A new pedestrian network, supported by an intensive and diverse land-use,connects landmarks, parks and attractive facilities in the area, and offers manyopportunities for people to meet, relax, play, run, do sports, and so on. Thedesign will attract public life and contribute to an active lifestyle, with positiveresults for health and social connectedness. The project can serve as anexample for other car dominated cities or for other areas in Toronto whereinfrastructure is causing problems and limits the walkability of the city.

The site chosen is therefore the inner city plot currently occupied by the Bijenkorf and the V&amp;D department stores occupying the whole block. By hypothetically demolishing the current department stores, the proposal reimagines the plot as a neighbourhood with courtyards that open the block up to the public. The fashion quarter becomes a place where people meet not only to browse and buy, but to learn the craft of handling clothing and to reflect critically on the fashion industry and sustainable consumption. Surrounding the open air courtyards are a fashion museum, local designers’ shops, café/bar, studio spaces, tailoring school, library and archive. The project looks at architecture through the lens of fashion. The relationship between inner and outer linings parallel the use of plaster on the courtyard facades and brick on the street facades.

These are local connections between the surface water and a deep saline aquifer. The study area of this research is the Lissertocht. This catchment, which is located inside the Haarlemmermeerpolder, contains a lot of boils that can cause problems for the main land use in this catchment agriculture. During summer the salinity is lowered by flushing the catchment with fresh water from outside the polder. <br/><br/>The objective of this thesis is to measure and model the salt concentrations and their sources in order to optimise the placement of sensors in a salinity monitoring network for optimal flushing in the Lissertocht catchment. <br/><br/>This thesis has provided insights into the detection of boils using different methods (Distribute Temperature Sensing (DTS), EC routing and visual inspection). The DTS method was the only method that is able to detect boils located at the bottom of the bigger main channels. Moreover, DTS is able to characterize the boil flux on a qualitative level and also on a quantitative level for a boil that is located near a pump; both have been done in this research. The boil flux is calculated with an energy balance and an 1D advection-diffusion model, the results correspond to values found in literature. <br/><br/>Data from CTD divers and sensitivity analysis have shown the influence of various processes on the spatial and temporal distribution of the salinity in the catchment. The sensitivity analysis in SOBEK also shows the areas which are sensitive to flushing, the flushing speed and the main pathways which the water from the inlets take. The complexity of the spatial and temporal distribution of the salinity is reduced to a small system of linear components using the Principal Component Analysis (PCA). For this case study, it was shown that over 90\% of the total variance in the system can be captured with three orthogonal linear components. A predictive model is built based on the PCA, this model is able to test the performance of a layout of sensors by reconstructing the principal components with virtual measurements. This shows that with a small number of sensors, a salinity monitoring network can be built that is able to predict the spatial and temporal distribution of the salinity in the catchment. Based on the knowledge from the measurements and modelling, three categories of key locations to monitor can be identified. <br/><br/>The optimisation of the sensor locations shows that a greedy algorithm is a very efficient way to solve the sensor placement problem. When more sensors are added with the greedy algorithm the performance of the monitoring network improves, but after six sensors the additional gain of an extra sensor is small in this catchment. The robustness analysis against disturbances shows that a monitoring network with more than three sensors is more robust. Moreover, the robustness analysis shows that a monitoring network is most sensitive to the locations of the boils.","salinity; boils; monitoring network; water resources management; Distributed Temperature Sensing; Lissertocht","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","","52.242361, 4.608252"

This thesis describes the theory behind morphological GAC, mathematical morphology and the implementation in Python of the actual algorithm. We made two adaptations compared to the original model. These are a change in the conditions of the balloon force, and an extra step at the end of each iteration. The change in the balloon force was made to keep edges stronger. The extra step was added to improve smoothness of the contours, since the smoothing parameter had no effect.","Morphology; Geometric Active Contours; Numerical; Python","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In each of these methods a set of input variables is required to perform the calculations. These inputs are not always exactly known and are therefore sometimes estimated or taken from databases. It is not always clear how big the uncertainty in these estimated inputs is, and on top of that: how big the effect on the predicted DP capability is. To be able to quantify how certain a DP capability calculation is and which input data contribute most to the output uncertainty, in this thesis the input uncertainties for both static and fast-time dynamic calculations are investigated. Each method is subdivided in three different design stages which are: conceptual design, preliminary design and as built design. For the static calculations all three design stages are evaluated but for the fast-time dynamic simulations only the as built stage is considered. <br/><br/>The static calculation part of the analysis consists of determining the input uncertainties, the input sensitivities to the output and finally calculating the output uncertainty. The method used for this calculation assumes that either the relation between input and output is linear or can be linearised at the point of interest. The input uncertainties are calculated using historical data of the Bibby Wavemaster 1 which is the vessel used as case study throughout this thesis and is specifically designed for the purpose of servicing offshore wind farms. It is observed that the input uncertainties of the main dimensions of the vessel are clearly reducing when moving through the design stages. Furthermore it is concluded that the environmental coefficients of wind, waves and current are the most uncertain, even in the conceptual design stage where input parameters of the main dimensions of the vessel vary the most. When considering the sensitivity in the three design stages no big changes were observed, meaning that in all design stages the main dimensions of the vessel are most sensitive to the output. Finally the uncertainty in the output was evaluated were it was observed that for the as built stage still a standard deviation of 4% uncertainty of the output is present, resulting in a calculated 99.7% confidence interval of either 12% too high or too low.<br/><br/>In the dynamic calculation part only the as built stage is considered. Again the uncertain parameters are defined but due to the PID controller in the dynamic model some new input parameters are now present. The gains of this PID controller are assumed to be uncertain and are therefore taken into account during the dynamic uncertainty analysis. Due to a limitation in the aNySIM licence bought by Damen it is impossible to change the wave coefficients which causes their uncertainty not to be taken into account. Since the dynamic simulations are considered to have strong non linearities and possibly even discontinuities due to thruster saturation, the calculation method used for the static part is not applicable anymore. Therefore it is decided to use Monte Carlo simulations to quantify the uncertainty in dynamic DP calculations. Due to the large computational time required to perform large amounts of Monte Carlo simulations with aNySIM, a machine learning method is used to capture the dynamic behaviour of the vessel. A small number of simulations performed by aNySIM is required to train the model which are selected using the Sobol design of experiments technique. This technique optimises the choice of the simulation points to make sure the complete space of possible inputs is covered. By using the machine learning model to obtain an output of a dynamic simulation only a fraction of a second is required instead of 17 minutes when using aNySIM. By running the Monte Carlo simulation on the created machine learning model it was observed that the 97.7% confidence interval for offset can either be calculated up to 8.7% too low or too high whereas the prediction for heading up to 23.1% too low or too high when compared to the base case. It is concluded that using DP for the purpose of people transferring by means of a ""Walk To Work"" bridge, uncertainties should be taken into account to reduce both safety and contractual requirements risks.<br","DP; Dynamic positioning; uncertainty analysis; uncertainties; Uncertainty; walk to work bridge; people transferring; Offshore Wind; capability; DP capability; Dynamic positioning capability; Dynamic Positioning","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Concentrated solar light offers a cheaper but more complex solution to extract more power without increasing the number of solar cells. For extraterrestrial applications generally the photovoltaic elements account for nearly half of the costs on solar array, this decreasing the number of solar cells significantly contributes to lowering the cost of electric power in space.<br/><br/>The solar array studied in this thesis provides a technologically innovative solution to reduce the cost of electrical energy for LEO satellites, in particular, to suit, for instance, the OneWeb satellite constellation mission at 1200 km altitude. Apart from being a structurally challenging design, another very important consideration is thermal feasibility. Concentrated solar light introduces hot spots of high temperatures, and heat dissipation at those locations is crucial. Hence, this thesis focuses on investigating the thermal performance of ConCur baseline design in orbit using thermal software ESATAN, and optimizing the design according to the thermal requirements, as well as performing electrical power calculations.<br/><br/>To broaden the knowledge regarding concentrator photovoltaics on Earth and in outer space, a literature study was first performed and the main findings are summarized in this document. Also, heat transfer in space is briefly explained as part of the methodology for modelling the solar panel in ESATAN, including a step-by-step guide. After modelling the panel it was put into the Low Earth Orbit simulated by ESATAN which provide outputs on temperature and absorbed flux results. The panel was optimized and it was found that the maximum cell temperature reaches +122 degrees C when nonoperational, and +70 degrees C when producing electrical energy. These and more results were post-processed and summarized and relevant conclusions were drawn. Knowing the panel temperature in orbit and slightly altering its dimensions, the amount of electrical power produced was calculated to match the required 300 W. Also a schematic of the hardware was made and the most probably cell layout designed. In addition, this report includes a brief cost estimation and comparison to the conventional solar panel of the same dimensions and that is capable of producing the same amount of power. It was estimated that the electrical power by ConCur would cost around 112 Euro/Watt which is 10 times less than conventional solar array. Finally, relevant recommendations are listed for further increasing the technology readiness level (TRL) of the concept.","CPV; space; thermal","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Among others, the dimension of the turbines increased by a factor 15 and the distance to shore increased by a factor of 50. The developments of the offshore wind farms increase the requirements for the installation vessels and as a consequence the present day rates can be up to $300.000. The global potential of the offshore wind market by the year 2030 is forecasted to be 60 GW for Europe and 22GW for the US Atlantic coast. The developments in the market, lead to demands during the construction of offshore wind turbines. The construction phase became more demanding over the years, while the logistical strategy of sailing back and forth to the offshore wind farm with a jack-up vessel, is similar as applied in 1991. The six demands can be fulfilled by performing four required activities at the offshore port. The potential of seven support structures that fulfil the boundary conditions for the offshore port are determined. Important boundary conditions are a maximum vertical load of 12.600 ton, suitability in a water depth range between 30 and 50 meter and a minimum surface area of 17.500 m2. Besides boundary conditions that have to be fulfilled, there are also maximum allowed conditions that determine the workability of a port concept. For a floating port concept the motion response is the leading workability condition. Based on the mobility, motion response and a cost indication, three port concepts are selected. These port concepts are a single barge, a single jack-up barge and a combination of a small jack-up barge and a single barge. The current logistical strategy for construction of an offshore wind farm is compared to various logistical concepts that include an offshore port. The logistical concept with a feeder vessel that sails from the onshore to the offshore port and an installation vessel that sails between the offshore port and the wind farm has the highest potential saving. Taking into account the assumptions made throughout this research, for each executed project by the offshore port the savings are expected to be €23.000.000. These savings consist of a sooner generation of energy and by savings on the construction of an offshore wind farm. The discounted cash flows for the three port concepts shows a potential for the offshore port concept. The net present value of the three offshore port concepts deviates between 52 and 216 million euro. The financial results are most sensitive to the ratio between wind farm capacity and the turbine capacity, also the market share that is interest in applying the offshore port and the day rate of the vessels. When the offshore wind market follows the tendency of developments of the last years, there is a market potential for an offshore port concept to reduce the construction costs. The main recommendations are to analyse the interest of potential port owners, perform a motion response into more detail and validate the financial assumptions.<br/><br","Workability; financial; Offshore; port; Construction; Market; Logistics; Wind","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The open connection of the Nieuwe Waterweg has become the subject of debate. So far, the Dutch Delta Approach do not take closure of the Nieuwe Waterweg into account. A group of six engineers do anticipate on the closure of the Nieuwe Waterweg and have prepared a scheme for that purpose, called: Plan Sluizen (or Plan Spaargaren). The closure scheme includes provision of navigation locks and a discharge complex. Focus of this report will be on the development of and checking the technical feasibility of the design for a flexible discharge facility in the closure. <br/>At present a part of the river Rhine water is discharged through the Nieuwe Waterweg to the North Sea. Since the water cannot be rerouted, a discharge facility must be included in the closure complex. <br/>First, the Nieuwe Waterweg, as a part of the Rhine-Meuse delta has been analysed and the effects of climate change in this area have been mapped out. Subsequently the report zooms in into the closure, lock and discharge complex that has to be constructed in the future. The two most important requirements are: the closure must be able to withstand the normative water level at sea, including expected sea level rise; the discharge complex must be able to discharge a 20% of the normative Rhine discharge at every random moment.<br/>Looking into the location of the closure and discharge complex went hand in hand with deciding whether to construct one large complex accommodating all components at one location, or to divide the components over two locations. A location for all the components together would be positioned in the Nieuwe Waterweg. When dividing the components of the closure complex, the two locations to be considered are somewhere in respectively the Oude Maas and the Nieuwe Maas, close to the Beneluxtunnel. <br/>A discharge method using Venturi was chosen. Venturi tubes can be used in natural flow conditions, driven by a water head, and improve the efficiency of pumps constructed into the Venturi tube. In future there will be a time when the natural water head has become too small, due to sea level rise, to discharge the required amount of water. The discharge sluice will be changed into a pumping station. <br/>It turns out that 72 pumps are needed with a capacity of 50 m3/s for normative river discharge conditions in 2100. For the normative discharge in 2018 no pumps are needed. For average river discharge, coinciding with storm surges, discharge using the natural water head is possible up to 2100.<br/>The dimensions of the discharge structure were determined. The structure will be adaptable by using different modules in the centre piece of the Venturi tubes. <br/>After determination of the overall dimensions the stability of the structure has been checked. Concrete calculations have been made to check the concrete dimensions of the main parts of the discharge structure.","Nieuwe Waterweg; Plan Sluizen; Plan Spaargaren; Deltaprogramma; discharge complex; afvoercomplex; Nieuwe Maas","nl","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

With the change of government and restoration of democracy starting from 2011, policy reforms are anticipated leading to large-scale economic development and growth. This growth is expected to result in rapidly increasing trade volumes. Myanmar’s maritime infrastructure needs upgrades: existing ports are mainly up-river, have limited draught and need continuous dredging. Currently, six deep sea port projects are being planned, but it is not known whether these sites have been selected based on rational, commercial and technical considerations or on (geo)political interests from the past. If these sites have been selected based on outdated political considerations, rather than commercial, well-grounded and sustainable development, they may struggle to obtain finances and support. Especially in the past, port sites were often allocated based on (geo)political considerations. However, because site selection is critical to port development and the long-term success and growth of a port, research into optimum and sustainable site selection is of significant value. The research objective is development of a strategy for deep sea port site selection and port development in Myanmar, by developing, validating and applying a framework for sustainable site selection, integrating a stakeholder-inclusive approach and ecosystem services. This framework is developed based on literature and desk study, and a comprehensive case study conducted in Myanmar. The strategy elaborates upon the optimum site selection (process), conceptual lay-outs and biggest challenges. Following the developed two-step site selection process, a short list with the sites Pathein, Yangon, Mawlamyine and Dawei was obtained. By means of a Multi-Actor Multi-Criteria Analysis and a cluster-based ranking, Mawlamyine and Yangon ended first. Yangon seems like a logical choice for deep sea port development, as it is the economic center of the country with the best hinterland connectivity. Despite pressure from stakeholders, it is concluded that Yangon is not a suitable location for deep sea port development because of physical restraints. However, it is a crucial port and must be part of the strategy. Yangon and Thilawa port should maintain and strengthen their current activities, and this appears best in combination with a deep sea port near Kalegauk Island (near Mawlamyine), which is connected with a high-quality road connection to Thailand and the Greater Mekong Subregion. Besides, this site offers many opportunities with respect to Ecosystem Services, by using Ecosystem-Based design principles. This port will accommodate the large Post-Panamax vessels and Yangon and its hinterland will be connected to it by sea, road and rail. Yangon port functions as a feeder port or extended gateway in this combination. This combination of ports can for instance be found in Thailand, Cambodia and Vietnam. Besides the combination Kalegauk Island and Yangon, a combination of Pathein (Near Nga Yoke Kaung) and Yangon may be a possible port combination. However, this needs additional research.","Site Selection; Sustainable Port Development; Stakeholder-inclusive approach; Ecosystem Services; Myanmar; Framework; Deep Sea Port","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This model explored the effects of vehicle automation on the performance of the transportation and spatial system of the case-study city of Copenhagen, Denmark. Different model runs provided insight in the possible range of outcomes. Considerable problems may arise in the transportation network with the introduction of automated driving because, using the car might become very attractive. A city’s land use does, however, not change as much as many could expect. The causes of (un)desirable outcomes<br/>were identified with the Patient Rule Induction Method. The ranges of uncertainties in the value of time in an automated vehicle and in the level of adoption of car-sharing were found to influence desirable versus undesirable futures the most. Mitigating measures should focus on these scenarios to prepare for a future with automated driving.","Transportation; Land use; Smart mobility; System Dynamics; Exploratory Modelling and Analysis; Patient Rule Induction Method; Automated driving","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Transport, Infrastructure and Logistics","",""

The concert space is envisioned as a viable opportunity to bring together leisure and recreation, but also a lucrative public realm where various social groups can initiate interaction. The base of the building is imagined as a thick plinth. The intimidating thick plinth as a mass is mediated with arches and vaults in various axes to open it to the adjacent streets. To augment this feeling of an over-arching mass, concrete was used to materialize the external façade. This arrangement of porous and non-porous had to also be translated into the spatial arrangement of the plan. To achieve this, various programs were first organized and then categorized as solids and voids. The solids are treated as functions in the building and the voids are the transition spaces designed like the vaults and arches. <br/><br/>The project is about monochromatic tectonic nature of the architecture with a subtle introduction of color through the use of carpet, furniture or even people. The building is inherently in grey concrete while color is added with the bright carpet flooring and the furniture.

As social resilience is defined as the capacity of society to cope, adapt or transform societal relations towards external stress, space that is a ‘construction’ and a function of the structure of society hosts the ability in fostering societal robustness against external perturbations (Alan H. Kwok, 2016; Raffestein 2012; Hillier,1984). <br/>World Global Risks report 2018 considers extreme weather events and natural hazards as a major disturbance towards risk perception (WEF, 2018). At present, Mumbai as well as other cities are at risk from natural and man-made hazards (floods, fires, ethnic violence etc.). Although, Mumbai did witness acts of benevolence by its people during the times of crisis such as the floods, the past and present situation of Mumbai’s spatial and social fragmentation underlines threats towards external stresses. Besides this, the geographical isolation of Mumbai, a man-made archipelago with a population of over 22 million (Review, 2018) makes the accessibility to resources that could maintain and foster resilience even more difficult. Hence, the reliance on social solidarity as a means towards fostering social resilience is a key to safeguarding the future of Mumbai and its people. Although, resilience is not a final state but a process, it is the system’s ability to maintain its integrity and to return to its original state, a state of equilibrium, normality, when it is confronted with a disruption or hazard” (Holling,1973). <br/>Through the case of Dharavi - Mumbai, a historic, unplanned settlement located in the heart of Mumbai that faces challenges and highlights potentials in the formation and maintenance of social solidarity, the thesis aims at developing a strategic spatial framework towards fostering social resilience under the purview of the ‘social logic of space’.

Yet as the city pursues global ambitions to be a key knowledge hub, as well as undertakes a process of liberalising the housing market, this has seen a dramatic erosion of this long-held diversity. Monofunctional enclaves have begun spreading throughout Amsterdam, and the question must be raised as to how the city can maintain its traditional attitude towards diversity whilst still fuelling its quest for global integration. <br/>The project aims to present a strategy that can operate as a tool to densify throughout the city, whilst encouraging a myriad of social and community spaces to be developed. This strategy aims to be adequately flexible that it can be expanded as desired and required over time. It takes advantage of the expected advent of the removal of the car from central Amsterdam, and interrogates what are the opportunities on this land that once was dominated by the car towards purposes more shared and social. <br/>The project presented here is just one of these stories.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Complex Projects","",""

Due to its specific location in the Yangtze river plain, Hangzhou is dealing with water issues for centuries. To support daily life and protect themselves from flooding threats, the people living there have been maintaining a close and intelligent relationship with water. The interaction between nature and human activities has formulated unique water management infrastructure at different scales. However, the growth of population led to rapid urbanization and inappropriate land uses in the previous dense waterway network. With the trend of increased occurrence of flooding, modern engineering approach of water management is being challenged. Vernacular water-management examples in Hangzhou will be explored according to two different natural watersheds. Based on the understanding of these examples, this project intends to develop a set tool-kits, methods, and possible interventions by testing principles and lessons learned in different scales and dealing with different conditions between the natural environment and human activities.","Water urbanism; Vernacular practices; Chinese landscape","en","master thesis","","","","","","ISBN: 978-94-6366-057-0","","","","","","European Master in Urbanism (EMU)","",""

(mentor); Gramsbergen, E.H. (mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2018","The aim of this thesis project is to address a highly problematic landscape in an alternative conceptual way. Instead of following a problem-solving approach, I will try to see how the way a specific site works in space and time can be related to a number of concepts. Furthermore, how do these concepts become part of wider, both theoretical and practical discussions about the role and the limits of planned and designed human interventions on the natural and the urban landscape. <br/>The landscape in question is Kifissos, a heavily abused urban river in Athens, Greece. Kifissos used to be a river. As the city evolved it became part of the city’s infrastructural network, functioning as a highway, a sewage and drainage collector. The river is strictly contained within heavy concrete boundaries. This condition is a result and expression of the conceived necessity to dominate and control nature, in order to guarantee for the safety and functionality of the urban world. The binary division between urbanity and nature is in our case expressed by the opposition of the two identities of the river and the highway as well as by the spatial isolation of the two systems from their surrounding environment.<br/>The opposition between the over-controlled elements of the landscape and their unpredictable, uncontrolled dynamics is also reflected in the urban tissue, in the tension between the designed/formal and spontaneous/informal patterns of urbanization. By studying how the urban landscape of Athens has evolved through the years, we can see that the development of these opposing patterns is closely related to the underlying structure of the landscape and the introduced element of the highway.<br/>Within this wider theoretical framework that describes the case of Kifissos not only as an urbanized river, but also as an over-controlled landscape and a ground for conceived oppositions, the design will not depart from the imposition of external forms and structures. It will rather be born out of an excavation on the site that will investigate the common ground between things conceived as opposites. Reading the existing landscape will result in a number of design tools, compatible with the identity of the city and the landscape, that will guide the design process.<br/>The resulting designed landscape works as an experiment of how a concept driven design does not necessarily consists of distanced ideas. Rather it can result in a flexible landscape architectural framework able to incorporate social, environmental and technical aspects closely related to the realities of the existing milieu.<br/>Furthermore, it explores and indicates how landscape architecture, as a discipline, has the capacity to work as an integrative common ground, bringing together conflicting notions such as natural and engineered, formal and informal, concept and reality, process and form, the designed landscape and the practices of everyday life.<br","Fonceptual approach; Urban River; Natural/engineered; Formal/informal; Over-control; Integrative landscape","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences","",""

Energy efficient buildings with smart and renewable energy technologies are developments to realize a more sustainable built environment. Photovoltaics, energy efficient lightning and smart grids are examples of these active building components which are broadly implemented to optimize energy efficiency. However, crucial resources for these technologies are critical materials. The European Union outlines critical materials (CRMs) as materials which are highly important for our current economy while the risk of disruption of supply is high. This is not only depending on the limited availability in the earth’s crust, but also on the concentration of their mining areas which causes political interventions. To become less dependent on the import of these materials, more attention must be paid on the current stocks of the EU and an optimized use of critical materials. Hence, a circular use of these materials is required to retrieve the critical materials at the end of the life-time of a product. The extreme small quantities of critical materials within many different applications make them hard to trace. Hence, data on the exact location materials and their next opportunity is required. Data about the stocks and flows of critical materials is considered as highly important to the European Commission and new possibilities need to be developed to link information to datasets of dynamic economic models. These datasets should be standardized to easily compare and combine them.<br/>A positive development in the built environment is the increasing use of Building Information Modelling (BIM). A BIM model makes it easy to collect data of the whole lifecycle of a building and share it amongst all involved stakeholders in the process. This data can be easily exported to other formats for further use. <br/>The aim of this research is to test if BIM is compatible to facilitate knowledge of and solutions for critical materials in the built environment. Firstly, relevant information has been determined on critical materials and circular use of building products containing critical materials, to optimize their lifetime. Subsequently, BIM is tested as an approach to process this information into standardized datasets to make it easily accessible and comparable. <br/>As a case study, a sensor has been analyzed to show a relevant example of the current use and composition of objects containing CRMs. Literature and empirical results shows the difficulty of circular use of critical materials. The extreme small components and amounts of critical material make it difficult and labour intensive to dismantle objects containing CRMs. Thereby the recycling rate of critical materials is low. More efficient use of the materials can be achieved through technical changes in designing for a longer lifetime, new business models and more responsibility for manufacturers and users. Documentation of all required information to lengthen the lifetime of CRMs in BIM appears to be an appropriate solution through the use of IFC files. Herein standardized datasets can be created and exported into many formats for further use. On the basis of specified information in IFC’s, objects in a BIM model can be find searching for instance for ‘critical materials’, ‘Gallium’ or ‘Ga’ and schemes can be exported outlining this information. Concluding a framework is created which provides information on critical materials, material selection processes, optimized used of the materials and finally converts this data into the so called ‘Property Sets’ suitable for IFC. A further challenge is the transparency of the supply chain to receive all the required information. To document all elements, full collaboration and transparency from the beginning of the supply chain is required.<br","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Sturkenboom &amp; author came up with an idea to use the material of old boat hulls as facade elements to provide a solution to an environmental problem. The approach then was rather practical, whereas the approach within this thesis is a theoretical one where a focus lies on solving the computational challenges this subject provides. This thesis proposes a work-flow that includes an algorithm that finds matches between the material and design. The overall work-flow attempts to provide a solution for an environmental problem by creating a facade system that uses a discarded material as panelling. The ability of the algorithm to find matching shapes is provided by agent based modelling. This computational technique uses agents, which can be described as a computer system situated in some environment, that is capable of autonomous action in this environment in order to meet its design objectives. The outcome of the algorithm within this thesis are cutting positions on a 3D boat geometry, which provides a basis for the code that is able to instruct machinery to process and produce the design. This process is tested digitally on a case study design as a starting point for such a workflow. The intention of this work-flow as a whole is not to provide architects with a solution that creates perfectly smooth facade designs using discarded material, but as a new direction into which designers can venture where the algorithm can be used to materialize a design idea as closely as possible with discarded materials. The outcome is a logic that defines the form finding process and a work-flow in which it is situated, both combined form a starting point which is to be developed in the future in order to move this idea from idea on paper to built in reality.","Agent-Based Modelling; Optimisation; complex geometry; GFRP; boat hull","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Building Technology | Sustainable Design","Graduation project",""

Impact is an effect of a source on a receptor. Existing impact modelling studies describe impact either from source or from receptor perspective. In spatial planning, both source and receptor are variant over space. However, incorporation of the spatial dimension in existing impact modelling studies is limited, especially in presentation of outcomes. <br/><br/>The objective of this research is to answer: what spatio-temporal method is suitable to assess the impacts of organic waste collection system scenarios in Amsterdam? Tools used are QGIS and GRASS GIS, combined with PyQGIS scripting. <br/><br/>Five impact indicators were defined: three nuisance indicators (noise, odour and congestion), all quantified in three factors (intensity, temporality and affected population), and two sustainable planning indicators (CO2 emission and waste collection), quantified in intensity factor only. Calculations are performed using simple theoretical principles, implemented from both source and receptor point of view. <br/><br/>It was found that basic spatial tools and calculation principles suffice to quantify impact spatio-temporally. For congestion and waste collection modelling network calculations are needed. All indicator outcomes except for CO2 emission are relevant to present spatially. Both source and receptor point of view have their advantages and challenges, and therefore are complementing each other. Aggregation of factor values into one results in loss of information and transparency, which is contradicting to information and transparency gained by the high granularity spatio-temporal model. However, overview and simplicity in presentation of outcomes could be maintained by describing all impact factors per indicator in one clock-like marker. Impact assessment outcomes should be presented for individual sources and receptors. When presenting them on small scale, spatial aggregation into total values per neighbourhood is needed as well. Compared to presentation in a non-spatial graph, the spatial presentation of outcomes is of added value.","impact assessment; spatio-temporal; organic household waste","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Geomatics","","52.370216, 4.895168"

Large-scale bed forms are present in shallow seas with sandy beds such as the North Sea. The most dynamic bed forms are sand waves. Due to their dynamic behaviour, sand waves can interact within offshore human developments and together with their dimensions pose a threat; e.g. decrease in navigation depth, exposure of submarine cables, interaction with foundations of offshore wind turbines and destabilization of bed protections. A thorough understanding of the dynamics can result in less risks for the offshore wind sector and therefore bring down the levelized cost of electricity from offshore wind. <br/>Currently, sand wave field dynamics are investigated by data-driven analyses. These analyses are based on seabed surveys over preferable more than 10 years and are considered most reliable at the moment. However, these surveys are very costly and/or often not available. Complex numerical models may provide an approach to analyse sand wave dynamics in a cost and time efficient way, though two aspects have to be considered. Not all relevant processes regarding sand wave dynamics are yet understood. Furthermore, due to the large scale of sand wave fields in combination with the fine grid resolution required to model sand waves, large computational efforts form a difficulty for numerical modelling of sand wave fields. Previous numerical studies focused on reproducing the length and height of sand waves. The migration direction is the next step towards the full prediction of sand wave fields and the subject of this research. <br/>Recent data-driven analyses showed migration directions of sand waves in opposite direction over small spatial scale, possibly related to underlying seabed topography. Understanding the governing processes of the migration direction of sand waves including underlying seabed topography is the focus of this research using the numerical process-based model Delft3D. <br/>To this end, an idealized model is used in which underlying seabed topography (tidal sand bank) is included. For a symmetrical tidal velocity signal, it is shown that the presence of the tidal sand bank influences the hydrodynamics on the scale of sand waves. Horizontal tide-averaged flow towards the top of the tidal sand bank on both flanks is observed. This results in sediment transports and migration directions on both flanks of the tidal sand bank towards the top of the tidal sand bank. The horizontal tide-averaged flow pattern around the tidal sand bank is disturbed by the inclusion of a residual current. Sand wave migration on both flanks in the direction of the residual current is the result. Including the S4-tide constituent does not disturb the tide-averaged horizontal flow pattern around the tidal sand bank. However, the asymmetry of the tidal velocity signal enhances migration in the direction of the asymmetry. <br/>Finally, it is shown that also for a more realistic model the transition in migration direction can be explained due to the presence of the tidal sand bank. The tidal sand bank influences the hydrodynamics by creating areas in which the tide-averaged sediment transport in the ebb direction are enhanced and areas in which the tide-averaged sediment transports in the flood direction are enhanced. In this way a transition in the migration direction over the tidal sand bank is observed. The migration directions from the model results and migration direction from data-driven analyses show a comparable transition over the tidal sand bank.<br","Sand waves; Tidal sand bank; Numerical Modelling; Domain Decomposition; North Sea; Delft3D","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering","","51.7, 2.928"

A simplified thermal model that assessed those concepts shows that none of them will be able to fulfill the thermal requirements. As a result another more complex concept that integrates the deployment mechanisms of the primary and secondary mirror has been developed. Attention has been paid to athermalization, actuator design and the design of the ribbon connecting the primary and secondary mirror.

The main advantage of thin absorber layers is the possibility to fabricate flexible solar cells. However, due to limited absorber layer thickness and weak absorption coefficients at long wavelengths, light management techniques need to be implemented in order to increase the<br/>device performance. Advanced substrate texturisation is one of the promising light management techniques that have drawn much attention recently. In state-of-the-art devices, randomly textured interfaces are often used to increase the optical performance. However, the introduction of periodic diffraction gratings resulted in world record conversion efficiencies for hydrogenated amorphous/nanocrystalline silicon (a-Si:H/nc-Si:H) tandem solar cells.<br/><br/>A different method of advanced texturisation is introducing modulated surface textures (MST). These MST structures combine various surface morphologies (random and/or periodic) to reach higher levels of light scattering over a broader wavelength range. Modulated surface textures based on large periodic gratings and small random textures have been successfully employed in single junction<br/>nc-Si:H solar cells, resulting in a world record efficiency of 11.8 %. An MST structure based on large random features and small periodic gratings, however, has not been reported yet. <br/><br/>The aim of this work is to investigate the possibility of fabricating MST structures based on micro-textured glass with superimposed periodic gratings, and to obtain a functioning n-i-p nc-Si:H solar cell, based on an MST substrate. An optical and morphological analysis of randomly textured substrates, periodic gratings, and modulated surface textures was carried out. It was found that MST substrates can be fabricated using ITO induced, wet-etched glass substrates, and a photolithography process. MST structures resulted in light scattering into greater, less distinct angles, when compared to either one of the individual surface morphologies. Therefore, these structures show promising light scattering behaviour for application in nc-Si:H solar cells.<br/><br/>Hydrogenated nanocrystalline silicon solar cells were fabricated on randomly textured glass substrates and MST structures. Two-dimensional (2D) periodic gratings, with square and hexagonal lattice structures, were superimposed on randomly textured glass to obtain MST substrates. nc-Si:H solar cells based on hexagonal MST structures seemed to outperform their square lattice counterparts. A functioning device with an active area efficiency of 6.46 % and short-circuit current density (Jsc) of 19.74 mA/cm2 was fabricated. This work reports the first functioning nc-Si:H solar cell, based on a periodic-random modulated surface texture substrate. The best performing solar cell on randomly textured glass, however, exceeded this performance with an active area efficiency of 7.67 % and JSC of 23.2 mA/cm2. It can be concluded that functioning nc-Si:H solar cells can be fabricated on 2D MST substrates. Further research focused on the morphological optimisation of MST substrates could help to prevent defective material growth, to improve the electrical properties of future devices.","PVMD; Solar Cell; Thin-Film; light management; modulated surface texture; random; periodic; light trapping; grating; texture; square; hexagonal","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Aan het eind van dat productie proces controleren menselijke inspecteurs of de geproduceerde rollen staal kwalitatief voldoen aan de eisen van de klant. Om dit werk te standaardiseren hanteren deze inspecteurs een aantal kwaliteitsniveau die specificeren welke productiefouten al dan niet aanwezig mogen zijn voor de toepassing van de klant. De inspecteurs worden opgeleid om te weten welke staalfouten al dan niet acceptabel zijn voor elk kwaliteitsniveau en hoe deze staalfouten eruit zien. Deze kennis wordt elk jaar getest door middel van een zogenaamde Measurement System Analysis (MSA) test. Tata Steel heeft het ontwikkelteam gevraagd om deze test te digitaliseren en te gamificeren. De grootste voorwaarde aan deze digitale versie is dat hij statistisch equivalent blijft aan het uitvoeren van een fysieke MSA. Deze thesis bespreekt hoe het onderzoek is verlopen naar zowel de digitalisatie als de gamificatie van de test. Als onderdeel hiervan wordt uiteen gezet welke opties zijn overwogen om de test zo goed mogelijk te vertalen naar een digitale versie. Bij deze digitalisatie is zowel gekeken naar de inspecteurs die de test maken als de begeleiders die de test opzetten. Daarnaast is er onderzoek gedaan naar het gamificeren van de test en zijn er 2 brede richtingen gevonden die het bedrijf kan volgen qua gamificatie: gamificeren en serious games. Ook is er onderzocht of er een patroon te vinden is karakter van de inspecteurs en of het ontwikkelteam hier gebruik van kan maken in het evalueren van mogelijke spelelementen die als toevoeging kunnen dienen. Dit patroon bleek te bestaan, aangezien het grootste deel van de inspecteurs hetzelfde Keirsey temperament hadden. Dit temperament is vervolgens terug geleid naar het Achiever spelerstype van Bartle. Deze termen en de consequenties hiervan worden uitgelegd in 2.3. Na het onderzoek bespreekt dit rapport welke uiteindelijke implementatie het team heeft gekozen. Hierbij is afleiding van het keuren zelf zoveel mogelijk vermeden. Daarom heeft het ontwikkelteam gekozen voor een oplossing die een spel creëert rondom het keuren, in plaats van het keuren zelf vermakelijker te maken. Hiermee wordt bedoelt dat het beoordelen van een plaat wordt gedaan in een omgeving waar het spel geen externe druk probeert te leggen op de inspecteur. Hiervoor is gekozen met het oog op de statistische equivalentie die de digitale test moest behouden. Het systeem is getest op deze statistische equivalentie door de resultaten van inspecteurs op de digitale test te vergelijken met die van de fysieke test. Hieruit is geconcludeerd dat het digitale systeem een bruikbaar alternatief is voor het uitvoeren van een fysieke MSA. Hierbij dient wel vermeld te worden dat dit onderzoek gelimiteerd is qua omvang. Het uitvoeren van verdere testen wordt dan ook geadviseerd. Ten slotte behandelt dit rapport de lessen die het ontwikkelteam heeft geleerd van dit project en doet het team aanbevelingen voor verdere ontwikkeling van het programma. Door middel van het toevoegen van enkele elementen kan Tata Steel op basis van dit werk een aantal interessante richtingen uit.

A major innovation would be the successful transformation of the current passive power grid towards an active and ICT-based smart grid. Among the technical efforts that will help to pursue this goal, the renewed interest in DC (direct current) distribution and transmission applications is playing an important role. In particular, the interest in the DC universal distribution networks is renewed since most of the renewable energy generation technologies (e.g. PV modules, fuel cells) and loads (e.g. LED lighting, electric vehicles) are DC-native. Their direct connection would allow to skip conversion steps, thus providing higher efficiency.<br/><br/>The focus of this thesis lies on the steady-state power flow analysis, a numerical study used in electrical engineering to assess the flows of power in the network. The aim of the thesis is to review the state of the art in computational methods for AC and DC power flow analysis and to determine a suitable method to develop a power flow tool for the DC framework.<br/><br/>The literature study revealed that most algorithms aim to solve the non-linear power flow problem without taking into account characteristics typical of future DC networks, such as highly meshed topologies and constant power converters. An innovative power flow method has there- fore been developed in order to include different node behaviours, such as constant voltage, constant current, constant impedance, constant power and I-V droop control. A case study based on the IEEE European Low-Voltage Test Feeder is analysed to provide an example of the application of the power flow tool.<br/><br/>The thesis shows that it is possible to linearize the system equations considering the constant power node either as a current source or as a parallel of current source and impedance. Both methods allow very fast convergence for complex meshed networks, and can therefore be adopted for diverse studies such as market analysis and N-1 redundancy analysis, among others.","power flow; DC; steady-state; distribution grid; low voltage","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The open-hole strength of FRP is an important parameter in a composite design because it can be representative in simple features of composite components leading to stress concentrations such as cutouts, fastener holes or a flaw in the material. Therefore, an open-hole tension test is simulated in the finite element program ABAQUS to determine the failure load of an [45°/−45°] lay-up using the material AS4/PEEK. In ABAQUS, both static implicit and dynamic explicit analysis are performed. For both analyses, the failure loads, stability and failure mechanisms are examined. The geometry and material properties are chosen to match the properties used in van der Meer and Sluys in order to compare results. The model is build up of 8808 SC8R elements and the interface between the plies is modelled using the surface-based cohesive behaviour technique. The static and dynamic analysis revealed that there’s a large influence of non physical and time related variables on the simulated failure load of the laminate. The results of the dynamic target time step sensitivity analysis didn’t converge to a legitimate value for the failure loads. The same has been concluded for the mesh size sensitivity analysis. Based on the stability of the solutions a reasonable value has been chosen for these variables. Comparing the results of the static and dynamic analysis with the results of van der Meer and Sluys, illustrated that the failure loads differ largely. The failure mechanisms are different due to the homogenisation of the material that is fundamental to continuum models in ABAQUS. At the failure load in the static and dynamic analysis, the matrix fails under tension and shear through the whole thickness of the laminate in the same direction. This unrealistic event differs from the failure mechanism observed in van der Meer and Sluys. In order to overcome the unrealistic failure behaviour in the static and dynamic analyses, XFEM modelling techniques are recommended to bridge the problem with the damage propagation direction parallel to the fibre direction.","Composites; ABAQUS; Finite Element Analysis; Open-hole tensile testing","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering","",""

These wave barriers generally consist of stiff vertical walls buried in the soil to impede waves on their path from the source to the receiver. The geometries of the wave barriers that are used in practice are very simple. More complex geometries have not often been considered as it is difficult to estimate which changes would increase the effectiveness.<br/><br/>In literature, topology optimization was explored as a method to design wave barriers. This method was applied while modelling the soil as a homogeneous elastic half-space. The resulting wave barriers showed a significant increase in the achieved vibration reduction. However, the designs were often very complex and hard to manufacture. In this thesis the method was improved by introducing a layered soil and by ensuring the manufacturability of the designed wave barriers.<br/><br/>The improved method was then applied to multiple situations in order to investigate aspects of wave barrier design and effectiveness. Optimization of a wave barrier for a two-layered soil model showed the significance of implementing a layered soil model. The interface between two layers resulted in reflections that could diminish the effectiveness of a wave barrier if not accounted for. The optimization algorithm responded to these reflections by placing material in the path of waves that would otherwise reflect back to the surface.<br/><br/> A wave barrier optimized for a three-layered soil model that consisted of a softer layer embedded in a stiff layer and a stiff half-space showed a different approach to reflections. The wave barrier appeared to use the softer layer as a waveguide in order to reduce the energy at the surface.<br/><br/>The manufacturability was increased by adding constraints. This resulted in wave barriers with a more manufacturable design at the cost of a decrease in vibration reduction. In three of the four cases, the optimized wave barrier still performed significantly better than the reference wave barrier. In one case, the final design reverted back to the reference wave barrier when the manufacturability conditions were applied.<br/><br/>The goals set at the start of the thesis were largely accomplished. The model was able to more accurately reflect soil profiles found in practice by using a layered soil model and the topology optimization algorithm resulted in wave barriers that are relatively easy to manufacture while still showing a significant improvement over the standard reference wave barriers. The possible use of<br/>soft embedded layers as waveguides was discovered during the optimization. Future research into this possibility could prove valuable. Some concerns are posited with regards to the reliability of the wave barriers. In some cases, the optimized wave barrier appeared to abuse the idealized representation of the interface between layers. An initial investigation showed that in those cases,<br/>the effectiveness of the wave barrier was sensitive to changes of the interface depth. Further investigation would be required to determine the sensitivity of the designed wave barriers to other parameters related to the idealized representations of the interfaces.<br","Topology Optimization; Wave Barriers; Railway-induced vibration; frequency domain; 2D","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This model can act as a basis of discussion between the architect, the engineer, as well as the client and support a fast decision making process especially in the first steps of design. The main fields of interest for this project are Building Information Modelling (BIM) and parametric/associative design. BIM has revolutionised the industry by providing the practitioners with concepts and tools towards an integrated, object-oriented process. However, the current BIM technologies are often characterised by limited design flexibility. Parametric/associative design promotes the idea of designing structures, as systems of parameters which can generate numerous alternatives. This paradigm facilitates the development of complex geometries, enhances automation and supports optimisation algorithms. In this research, the advantages and limitations of the aforementioned fields, as well as a number of other concepts, such as Object-Oriented Programming, Extreme Programming and Model-Based Systems Engineering are investigated and the results are employed in the development of the model. The main parameters of viaduct design are determined and structured in a knowledge model considering their limitations and typical values. Moreover, the generic geometry of the components and their interaction is considered. This knowledge model starts with a strict top-down UML class diagram and gradually evolves into a parametric platform for viaduct design on Dynamo. Due to the complexity of the parametric script, a Python-based User Interface is created to increase the usability of the platform. The parametric model is seamlessly connected to Robot, a structural analysis software, through a Python script, in order to derive instant structural analysis results. The geometry of the deck is transferred to Robot, the structural analysis software, along with the properties of the beams, the support conditions and the loads of Load Model 1. A linear structural analysis is automatically conducted and the engineer can directly assess the results in Robot. The link between the applications ensures that both disciplines are working on the same design and merges their different knowledge areas into one model. The number of parameters considered in this research is 82, and they are divided in 3 categories according to the level to which the designer can influence them on the platform. As an outcome of the standardisation process and the restriction of the scope of the research, 51.2% of those parameters require input from the designer, while in the case of a symmetrical design (the same components are used on both sides of the viaduct) this percentage drops to 36.6%. This underlines the potential of such an integrated platform, since automation can significantly reduce the design time and both architects and engineers can focus more on the creative parts of the design and doing more design iterations. Important issues for the development of the platform are the validation of the results, in order to gain the trust of the user, as well as the limitations of the current parametric platforms. The Recommendations for further research include the immediate changes that can be implemented to the algorithm, such as the integration of cost analysis and the increase of the level of detail, as well as ways to unlock the full potential of this platform by considering cloud-based solutions and taking advantage of cutting edge technologies like machine learning.","Parametric design; BIM; Concrete Bridge; prefabricated","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Building Engineering","",""

Patients that are unable to relax the urethral sphincter are most commonly treated by mechanically emptying the bladder or by sacral root stimulation where the roots are selectively cut. <br/><br/>The stimulator to be made must send a high-frequency signal that cancels the blocking of the urethral sphincter. This method should be able to empty the bladder without the use of mechanical devices or selectively cutting nerves. <br/><br/>The whole project is divided into three parts: Control and Interface, Arbitrary Waveform Generator and Safety Module. These parts have been performed by three different subgroups. In this report, the Arbitrary Waveform Generator is discussed. The other parts are explained in the respective reports [1, 2]. <br/><br/>The requirements for this waveform are to generate a biphasic pulse with frequencies ranging from 1 to 15 kHz. The amplitude range of this pulse should be adjustable between 0 and 10 mA and the pulse width and interphase delay should be fully adjustable. In order to generate this signal, a power management system was necessary. In addition to the power management system, the LPC1343 microcontroller was chosen to control the system. One of its functions is to control a DAC by communication using the SPI protocol. The DAC can linearly control the output voltages between 0 and the offered reference voltage, in this case 3.3 V by sending 10 bits of data. Using a voltage to current converter, made by the Interface and Control subgroup, the output voltage is converted to a current between 0 and 10 mA [1]. Three additional signals from the microcontroller operate an H-bridge. This is a switching circuit that is able to direct the generated current through a load. Using a timer and four interrupt moments, the three signals are generated that can make a cathodic pulse, anodic pulse and can disconnect the current source. <br/><br/>The chosen DAC has a close to ideal behavior. Therefore, the conversion from the microcontroller to the voltage to current converter is very precise. The H-bridge works best at low frequencies. At 1 kHz, around 2% of a total pulse of 127.2 μs is needed to reach 63% of the cathodic or anodic amplitude. At high frequencies, the time increases. At 15 kHz, 24% of a total pulse of 8.4 μs is needed to reach the amplitude.","revalue; neural stimulator; waveform generator","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","2019-07-31","","","","","REValUE",""

Bitstory was designed to be implemented in the caregiving processes of De Buitenwereld. De Buitenwereld is a Dutch healthcare institution which provides care to families of children with (suspicion of) a psychiatric condition, aged 0-18. In 2015 De Buitenwereld was forced to change their caregiving processes due to the healthcare transition for the youth that was made in that year. This transition had several transition goals which healthcare institutions, such as De Buitenwereld, had to meet. One of the transition goals was to develop solutions that would support families in using their own support network, so that they would be less dependent on institutions. A great part of the families that receive care at De Buitenwereld are families of a child with autism. For this project, a focus was set these clients: parents of children with autism, aged 4-12. These parents suffer from high levels of stress and would benefit greatly from a strong support network. In an extensive exploration phase, lots of analyses was done into technologies, trends, parents’ needs and the company’s needs. In an extensive user research with a group of five parents of autistic children one main insight was distilled. This was the insight that parents lacked understanding from their network (family members, professionals, neighbors, friends, etc.) which let to having difficulties trusting them and thus building strong relationships. This ultimately resulted in parents not having the strong support network they need. But in order to get understanding from their network, parents have to explain and share lots of information with these others which costs them a lot of time and energy while they lack time and suffer from high levels of stress. All these factors hinder creating an understanding. Thus the solution had to support the parents in enhancing understanding of others so that they can build a stronger support network. In a conceptualization phase in which ideas were generated and transformed into design proposals, one proposal was chosen and further detailed into the Bitstory methodology. Bitstory is a new methodology for caregiving to empower parents of a child with autism (4-12 years old) by using tools to effectively capture, describe and structure important personal information into a visual story which can be shared at anytime and anywhere with any other who is involved in caregiving to enhance their understanding, strengthen relationships and build a strong support network.","autism; support network; empowerment; parents; caregiving; methodology","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","","","","","",""

The way in which the prepayment rate is predicted impacts on the hedging strategy. For example, if the prepayment model is deterministic only the average prepayments are forecast, and a linear hedge composed of swaps is sufficient. However, in condition of volatile markets the lack of a non-linear hedge can result in losses for the bank. Considering that the there is a correlation between the prepayments and the level of interest rates in the market, we propose a prepayment model which is only based on the refinancing incentive. This way, the prepayments' forecast might be less accurate, but the clear link with the market allows to extend the prepayment model to a stochastic environment. We showed that allowing the notional of a mortgage to be stochastic unveils the non-linear risk embedded in the prepayment option, arising the necessity to include non-linear instruments in the hedging portfolio. The calibration of the refinancing incentive on a data set of more than thirty millions of observations led us to choose the functional form of the prepayments that is able to capture the borrowers' behaviour the most, and it distinguishes the model from full-rational models in which the option to prepay is assumed to be always exercised rationally. Then, the linear and non-linear risks are addressed to a set of tradeable instruments, aiming to build a static hedge. Different combinations of swaps and swaptions are tested, in order to determine which derivatives have the highest replication power. This research can impact considerably the evaluation of the exposure to interest rate risk of mortgage providers, and it can improve the performance of the hedging of the prepayment risk. Moreover, since the linear and non-linear components of the risk embedded in mortgages are distinguished, it can also help in the pricing of the prepayment option, allowing banks to define the mortgage rates with more accuracy.","Prepayment option; Linear risk; Non-linear risk; Refinancing Incentive; Swaption; Mortgages; Hull-White","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

By viewing courage as a muscle, we can train it by gaining experience. Courage is defined as battle between someone's fear and someone's will. Fear and will are situated in two different parts of the brain. Courageous behaviour can be influenced in two ways: by changing the beliefs that create the fear and by giving the will some short term extra motivation. Changing beliefs is done by the design of a website that contains knowlegde about fears and how to gain pleasure from fears. Short term motivation to boost the users' will was done by designing a clock that has an internet connection to the website. The users can get their will out of their head by externalising it (make it real by putting it out into the world). By smacking the clock the users transition, together with the clock, from the thought world to the real world where their will is going to be made reality. At that point the clock stops showing the time and motivates the users to pursue their want.

(mentor); Eitelberg, G. (graduation committee); Veldhuis, L.L.M. (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2018","Increasing pressure of reducing fuel consumption has led to renewed interests in propeller propulsion devices for their high propulsive efficiency. In a propeller propulsion system, the torque applied to the propeller results in angular momentum in propeller slipstream. This angular momentum is not only a form of energy loss that does not contribute to the propulsive performance, but also disturb the wing lift and drag distributions leading to deviated wing performance compared to a clean wing case. A series of design solutions have been introduced for dealing with this term, and current thesis mainly focus on the concept of Swirl Recovery Vane (SRV). SRVs are a set of stationary vanes mounted at downstream of the propeller, aiming at recovering the swirl in the propeller slipstream, which may produce extra thrust without extra power consuming. Previous research mainly focus on design of SRVs for an isolated propeller case. Considering a wing-mounted tractor propeller configuration, with benefit already gained in terms of wing induced drag reduction by wing swirl recovery, the swirl residual in propeller slipstream gives opportunities of introducing SRVs for extra thrust production, such that the system performance can be further improved. Due to the lack of such research, current project is about design of Swirl Recovery Vanes for a maximized system propulsive performance for Wing-Mounted Tractor Propeller Propulsion System at cruise condition. A wing design case is also performed for the same propeller slipstream without installed SRV, by comparison of performance gain of these two cases, the conclusion can be drawn that whether it’s beneficial to introduce SRVs in a typical wing-mounted tractor propeller configuration. A Surrogate-BasedMulti-Fidelity optimization framework is developed for the design purpose. The strategy is to replace the direct optimization of expensive high-fidelity analysis by an iterative re-optimization of a corrected low-fidelitymodel. The low-fidelity method includes a slipstream model in which the velocities are obtained from RANS simulation of an isolated propeller, a lifting line based SRV designmodule and a surface singularity method based wing analysis and design module. The high-fidelity method is the Euler equationbased simulation. Furthermore, an alignment procedure between low- and high-fidelity results is established based on the shape-preserving response prediction(SPRP) algorithm, which assumes the variation of highfidelity results can be predicted by the low-fidelity results. Two main optimization tasks are performed to reach the final objective. The wing twist optimization for minimum induced drag under propeller slipstream indicates that the CDi can reduced up to 5.93%. A series of one-blade SRV design cases are performed at different streamwise and azimuthal positions relative to wing. Results indicate that an upstream installed vane causes an un-expected induced drag increase of a downstream wing through its wake and tip vorticies development. This can be avoided when the vane is moved to downstream of wing. The optimum system performance is obtained when the vane is located at down-going blade side(DBS). By extra thrust produced by vane, a system induced drag reduction of 6.08% drag counts is achieved, which is almost equal to that obtained by wing twist design. Further conclusion is drawn that SRV should be installed as close to wing trailing edge as possible to obtain an maximized system performance in terms of system induced drag reduction.","Swirl Recovery Vane; SRV; propeller; Shape-preserving response prediction; SPRP; Surrogate-based optimization; DIRECT; Wing optimization; slipstream; Multi-fidelity optimization; Global optimization","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering | Flight Performance and Propulsion","",""

This method is developed to overcome numerical instability, which is a problem for regular non-linear finite element analyses (NLFEA). The objective is to investigate to what extent SLA is able to predict the behaviour of the two main components of a Dutch house, namely the shear wall and the out-of-plane loaded transversal wall, during a monotonic pushover test. Both pre-stressed components are modelled, using the (new) non-proportional loading algorithm and two modelling approaches were applied: the smeared crack approach and the discrete crack approach. Besides, two finite element types were used: the new implementation of the SLA code for shell elements is validated by modelling the shear wall with plane stress elements as well. <br/>Results showed that SLA is able to predict the behaviour of pre-stressed masonry components using the non-proportional loading algorithm, except for the post-peak behaviour of the out-of-plane loaded transversal wall. As SLA is under development, the method still has difficulties to overcome. The defined stop criteria were helpful to temporarily deal with the identified problems, but further research needs to be done to actually solve the errors.<br","Sequentially Linear Analysis; Masonry; Brittle behaviour; Numerical modelling","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Bone tissue engineering strategies rely on the development of a scaffold that mimics the extracellular matrix, thereby providing an architecture that guides the natural bone regeneration process. Recently, scaffold systems have been developed to incorporate important extracellular signaling molecules which promote fracture healing and bone formation pathways. Among these signaling molecules, naturally occurring growth factors are of particular interest. This interest is due to their ability to enhance cell recruitment and ingress into the scaffold and promote osteogenic differentiation and angiogenesis, each of which is crucial to successful bone regeneration. However, a key challenge in growth factor delivery is that the molecule must reach the site of injury without losing bioactivity and remain in the location for an extended time in order to effectively aid in the formation of new bone. Among various strategies explored in the literature, incorporation of growth factors into particles can offer both protection of bioactivity and a sustained release profile. However, the particles can easily diffuse through the scaffold macropores and traverse to other areas of the body. In this work, a novel two-phase system for the sustained delivery of BMP-2 growth factors has been developed. The system consists of growth factors encapsulated in degradable nanoparticles (nanocarriers) which are immobilized in a porous scaffold. The nanoparticles incorporate a hydrolytically degradable crosslinker that can be easily tuned to achieve desired sustained release profiles. By chemically conjugating the nanocarriers to the scaffold backbone, this two-phase system is able to protect the growth factor from rapid degradation, improve the release kinetics, and achieve longer-term retention within the scaffold. Ultimately, the tunability of this novel growth factor delivery platform can be adapted to a wide variety of applications. Ultimately, this work shows that two-phase systems consisting of growth factor-loaded nanoparticles covalently bound to scaffolds have great promise, both by providing sustained release over a therapeutically relevant timeframe and the potential to sequentially deliver multiple growth factors.","bone regeneration; growth factor delivery; degradable nanoparticles; sustained delivery; chitosan scaffold","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2021-06-22","","","","","",""

After the flood in 1953, the Delta Committee was established which commenced the Delta Works to enhance water safety for the society and economy. The Maeslant Barrier and Eastern Scheldt Barrier are the largest and most technologically advanced flood defences which are part of the Delta Works. These storm surge barriers shorten the effective coastline to reduce the risk of flooding within the Rhine-Meuse Delta and the Eastern Scheldt. However, the climate is changing and the risk of accelerated sea level rise increases. The problem is that the current storm surge barriers are not designed to withstand significant sea level rise. Sea level rise influences the hydraulic loads on the barriers which consequently increase the failure probability of these flood defences. International research argues that future sea level rise is much more uncertain than previously thought because of the instability of the West-Antarctic ice sheet. Therefore, it is critical to identify the degree of uncertainty of climate change and sea level rise to develop effective strategies for the storm surge barriers. This study uses a risk analysis to analyze the critical risk factors which could affect the performance and remaining lifespan of the Maeslant Barrier and the Eastern Scheldt Barrier. When sea level rise exceeds the tipping point of the storm surge barrier, the barrier fails to deliver sufficient water safety and adjustments are required to comply with the strategies of the Delta Programme. Therefore, this research has developed feasible and affordable solutions to increase the performance and remaining technical lifetime in case of accelerated sea level rise.","Sea level rise; Climate change; Antarctica; Delta Programme; Maeslant Barrier; Eastern Scheldt Barrier; Tipping point analysis","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2018-09-19","","","","","",""

This manufacturing technique is attractive since it has the potential to eliminate the energy and time consuming autoclave consolidation. However, low quality is one of the biggest challenges in the application of in-situ consolidation. It seems that pressure contribution to the bond quality has received less attention than thermal one. Therefore, this work is initiated to simulate the pressure distribution between the compaction roller and the mandrel.<br/>The objective in this work is to predict the pressure distribution in the contact area between the rubber-covered roller and the mandrel in room temperature by finite element methods (FEM). Rubber material is characterized by mechanical testing and then modeled as hyperelastic material. 3rdd-order Ogden material model is found to well describe the strain- stress behavior of rubber material. The material constants are then implemented in FE models as an input. The pressure distribution is predicted by FE modes and the influence of compaction force, rubber thickness, pre-stretching force on the pressure distribution are discussed, followed by an optimization between compaction force and rubber thickness. Experiments are conducted to validate the FE models regarding the three influencing factors, that are: (a). compaction force, (b). with/without pre-stretching and (c). various rubber thickness. Rubber deformation can be captured by the digital image correlation (DIC) Pressure distribution is obtained from the Prescale pressure measurement film produced by Fujifilm®, which are the films that show different color densities under different pressures. Experimental results of strain and pressure distribution are compared with FEM results, followed by discussions and conclusions.<br/>It can be concluded that pre-stretching force should be used to avoid rubber-roller separation and prevent rubber from moving out to the sides. Both of the compaction force and rubber thickness affects the maximum pressure and contact length linearly. A trade- off between compaction force and rubber thickness can be made based on the force limit of the equipment and pressure requirements.","Thermoplastic Composite; in-situ consolidation; compaction roller; Finite Element Analysis; Experimental validation; Silicone rubber","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

Cities are expected to become more vulnerable to UPF due to more frequent and more intense extreme rainfall events with high spatial variability as result of climate change. Additionally increasing urbanisation results in more impervious surfaces, inducing shorter response times of the drainage systems. A high spatial and temporal resolution of the urban rainfall network is required to forecast UPF. Professional rain gauge networks do not provide this necessary resolution. A strategy to increase this density is to use rainfall data obtained from Citizen Weather Stations (CWSs). The downside of CWS networks is the low quality of measurements compared to professional measurements. This is caused by the use of lower quality sensor, web-platform processes , set-up of the weather station, stability of data transfer and cleaning of the CWS. Undetected Rainfall (UR) is one of the errors found in rain gauge data of a CWS network. An UR error is an incorrect zero rainfall value in the rainfall data, meaning that rainfall did occur at the gauge but it was not detected. A quality-control system that creates a more reliable CWS network is required to facilitate UPF forecasting. The aim of this research is to take a first step towards a quality-control system by developing and testing different automatic quality-control filters that flag for UR errors in rainfall data of a CWS network.<br/><br/>For this research 753 CWSs in the Rotterdam-The Hague region are used. They were obtained from Netatmo weathermap and give a density of 1 CWSs per 5.93 km2. This is not a uniform density because more CWSs are located in densely populated areas. The availability of the CWSs grew from 369 to 668, measuring at least once per day between October 2015 and October 2017. Two filters are developed to identify UR errors in CWS rainfall data. The first filter is the CWS filter which uses neighbouring CWSs within a radius of 8 kilometre to find the UR errors. The second filter is the radar filter, which identifies UR errors using the overlying radar pixel. The performances of these filters are tested by artificially placing zeros at 10% of the rainfall sequences of 10-min rainfall data from four automatic KNMI gauge datasets within the study area. Both filters are applied on these datasets and evaluated using confusion matrices. Finally, the two filters are applied on the 753 CWS rainfall datasets for a period between October 2016 and October 2017.<br","Citizen weather stations; Rainfall; quality-control filters; undetected rainfall","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

New techniques and growing experiences make it possible to move to challenging offshore domains and towards harsher conditions and deeper waters. From the oil &amp; gas industry a lot of expertise is already available on support structures. The focus in this thesis is on the installation of a jacket type sub-structure for an offshore wind turbine. In more detail: the horizontal added mass for suction bucket jackets during installation was studied, from the moment the bucket touches the water till the buckets are fully submerged. This is a period during installation with a lot of uncertainties and unknowns, especially inside the buckets. A suction bucket jacket is identical to the commonly known jacket type support structure, however, at the bottom of each leg a suction anchor is attached. For a structure of about 60[m] in height and 1000[tonne], these anchors have a rough dimension of 8-9[m] in diameter and have similar heights. Note that the combined mass of the enclosed water inside the buckets can almost reach twice the weight of the dry structure. A benchmark suction bucket with dimensions 10[m] in diameter, 10[m] in height and a wall thickness of 10[cm] was used to design a scale model of 50[cm] diameter, 62.5[cm] in height and a wall thickness of 0.5[cm]. This corresponds to a Froude scaling factor of 1:20. The experiments were executed at the hydrolab at Boskalis, Papendrecht. A tank of 20x3.5x3[m] was available there to execute the experiments. The water-depth in the tank was 1.12[m]. During the experiments a vertical pipe segment was forced to oscillate at a known frequency. The pipe was attached to a guiding system, restraining all motions but the surge direction. The applied force by the actuator was measured by a load-cell attached at the point where the crankshaft was connected to the pipe. Simultaneously a LBT-sensor measured the position of the pipe versus time. The experiments were done for the following settings for draft and scale model wave period range, each experiment was executed three times to reduce the error: Periods: 2.46 2.24 2.01 1.79 1.57 1.34 1.12 0.89 seconds. Drafts: 0, D/4, D/2 3D/4 D. The data was filtered and analyzed with the use of the linear Least Squares Method (LSM). The raw data was fitted by adjusting the amplitude and phase of a sinusoidal fit signal. The amplitude and phase provide information on the relation between damping and added mass in the system. Finally the results added mass (and damping) were checked with the theoretical potential theory. While for all frequencies the added mass stayed more or less constant for each draft, during sloshing the added mass decreased. The damping was more or less constant for all drafts at low frequency, but at a wave period of 9[s] the damping start to increase for deeper drafts. Sloshing occurred at the shortest two periods. This had a significant impact on the damping and added mass terms. At sloshing the added mass decreased rapidly with 40%, while the damping increased up to 300%.","Added mass; damping; suction bucket jacket; sbj","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The model was in fact applied for the first time to aluminium and an AA7075 aluminium alloy. By constructing an extended Kocks-Mecking plot from the measured tensile and interrupted tensile data the dislocation density, average dislocation segment length and physical yield stress were determined.<br/><br/>The aim of the present study was to get a better understanding of the role of precipitates in the evolution of the dislocation structure during plastic deformation. The recovery of anelastic strain during loading and subsequent unloading after plastic deformation was investigated as well. The yield criterion was used to study the anelastic loading, while a constitutive unloading model by Torkabadi et al. was used to study the unloading behaviour. The models were combined to define the fraction of unrecoverable anelastic strain. The anelastic strain is related to springback. Therefore a better understanding of the anelastic strain could be useful for making better predictions of springback after metal forming. The physical yield criterion was further extended by incorporating a continuous uniform dislocation segment length distribution. Insight on the dislocation segment length distribution, and the evolution thereof during plastic deformation, could help to better understand the mechanical behaviour of metals.<br/><br/>The evolution of the dislocation structure during plastic deformation is impeded by the presence of precipitates in the microstructure. Therefore, the physical interpretation of α in the Taylor equation which quantifies the dislocation structure, proposed by Arachebelata et al., was modified to incorporate the effects of precipitates in the microstructure. The dislocation structure parameter α should remain constant. However, the average dislocation segment length obtained from the extended Kocks-Mecking plot does not decrease sufficiently to accommodate a constant α. The introduction of the length between precipitates, which is independent from work hardening, into the Taylor equation ensures that α does remain constant, whilst in addition it provides an estimate of the distance between the precipitates. <br/><br/>Anelastic strain, caused by reversible glide of dislocations in the pre-yield regime, is introduced into or recovered from the metal during loading and unloading respectively. The anelastic unloading strain determined from the interrupted tensile tests was found to be smaller than what was expected according to the model. Three possible causes were identified: not all Frank-Read sources are at their critical state when unloading is initiated, dislocation loops propagating through the crystal undo portions of the anelastic unloading strain and the retracting dislocations remain stuck behind obstacles whilst retracting under the reducing applied stress. The constitutive model was found to be not suitable for studying the dislocation behaviour during unloading because the change of dislocation segment length with plastic deformation is not accounted for. The development of a physical unloading model is therefore recommended. <br/><br/>The distribution of the dislocation segment lengths could explain the non-zero value of the work hardening rate Θ at the abrupt change of slope between the pre and post-yield regime in the extended Kocks-Mecking plot. The value of Θ at this point could be an indication of the distribution width. The continuous uniform distribution is a rather unrealistic description of the dislocation segment length distribution. Therefore, other distribution types are proposed for the further development of the dislocation segment length distribution model of the physical yield criterion.<br","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To this end, post-failure analysis of a bridge in Japan’s Iwate Prefecture that collapsed in 2013 is conducted. Failure of this particular bridge is atypical because piers have also toppled over, which can be attributed to the spread footing foundation not anchored to the bedrock.<br/>Two hypotheses are formed regarding the failure mode of this bridge. One assumes that initially the deck was dislodged and the piers subsequently toppled over, while the other follows the scenario of simultaneous failure of deck and pier. In order to predict which failure mode is governing, estimates of hydrodynamic forces based on design standards and previous research are formulated in conjunction with an analysis of the capacity of a potential bearing type.<br/>Experiments in a flume are performed at a 1:37 scale to simulate steady-state hydrodynamic forces on the bridge. The flow depth and Froude number of the flow are varied across a wide range. Simulated debris is also lodged against the bridge model during some experiments. Observations on under which conditions a free-standing bridge model will or will not fail are carried out. These conditions are then replicated while the bridge model is connected to a load cell to determine the forces associated with failure.<br/>Results show that the resistance against horizontal movement of a bridge deck actually increases as Froude number increases, as negative lift forces dominate over drag forces. Standalone piers always have sufficient resistance against overturning as long as no debris is present. Addition of simulated debris against the pier breaks down its streamlined shape and can cause toppling over of a pier.<br/>Failure of the bridge as a whole (intact deck-pier connection) is not observed under any conditions during the experiments and this hypothesis is discarded. Subsequent failure of deck and pier only happens when simulated debris accumulations are introduced into the experiment. Deck displacement occurs at inundation ratios greater than 2.0 at moderate Froude numbers (0.14 ≤ Fr ≤ 0.32). Pier failure occurs at Fr ≥ 0.34 when the flow depth exceeds the height of the pier.<br/>Possible countermeasures and improvements that may be incorporated into the design of bridges so that they may be more resilient to collapse during a flood in the future are suggested.","Bridge deck; Bridge pier; Drag coefficient; Lift coefficient; Moment; River; Flood; Spread footing; Experiment; Flume experiments","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

(mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2018","There is a trend in the miniaturisation of satellites. They not only become smaller, but lighter and more powerful as well. A large growth in the nano-satellite sector is present in the form of CubeSats. These milk carton size satellites use commercial of the shelf components in order to keep the costs low and to allow for technology demonstrations for future larger space missions. In order to increase their current mission lifetime from 1 - 2 years, electric micro<br/>propulsion systems are being developed. These systems are able to provide sufficient velocity increments in order to maintain the CubeSat within the required orbit.<br/><br/>Electric micro propulsion systems make use of Coulomb forces to accelerate charged particles. The method is to inject a propellant gas such as xenon into a cylindrical discharge chamber. The propellant is ionised by means of electron bombardment. The electrons that are required in order to do so are pulled from the cathode into the thruster system. Inside the discharge chamber they experience an electromagnetic field, where the resulting Lorentz force makes them gyrate in the projection plane that is perpendicular to the magnetic field lines. As the propellant is inserted in the discharge chamber, a neutral gas pressure builds up. Next, the electrons that are emitted from the cathode are colliding with the neutral gas particles, which causes them to be ionised. These charged particles get accelerated out of the discharge chamber by the electrostatic field in order to create the required thrust. The goal is to develop an affordable, low complexity and efficient cathode for a high performancemicro propulsion system that can be used on small satellites. In the future, the whole system can be miniaturised in order to realise an electric thruster system that can be implemented on CubeSats in order to expand their mission lifetime.<br/><br/>The current graphite needle tip cathode can be successfully used as an electron source for propellant ionisation and plasma plume neutralisation in combination with the xenon fed engineering model electric thruster. The thermionic LaB6 cathode is capable of achieving an emission current up to 64 mA with 56 Watts of input power. This is realised by using graphite needle tips on the end of molybdenum posts that heat the LaB6 emitter pellet. The micro High<br/>Efficiency Multistage Plasma Thruster is operated with a mass flow of 2.0 sccm. It uses an anode voltage and anode current of 700 V and 63 mA respectively. The cathode current is equal to 5 mA. Furthermore, the nominal power to<br/>thrust ratio is equal to 25.5 W/mN and the specific impulse that is achieved equals 930 s, dependent on the applied settings. The divergence efficiency ranges from 80 - 90 % and the total system efficiency is currently equal to 80 %.<br/>This total efficiency needs to be improved in the subsequent iterations of the design.","electric propulsion; cathode; lanthanum; hexaboride; heater; graphite; richardson; langmuir; plasma; lorentz; micro; newton; force; thrust; Thruster; discharge; chamber; spark; satellite; space","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","Advanced Projects",""

ADS-B data of two full days of European air-traffic is collected in order to simulate and compare current flown routes with Great Circle Routes (GCR). Only commercial aviation is taken into account. The impact of having parts of the airspace unavailable for civil use is investigated as well. For European flights above 10,000ft it is found that by optimizing the lateral route only, an average of 1.8% total fuel savings can be realized. Allowing aircraft to resolve conflicts both horizontally and vertically, increases the fuel savings to 3.1%. Direct routing increases the airspace safety as aircraft are more spread out over the airspace. The results suggest that under free flight the total flight efficiency and airspace safety is improved by solely flying lateral direct routes above 10,000ft.","Direct Routing; Fuel Benefits; Air Traffic Control; Air Traffic Management; Great Circle Route; BlueSky","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

Together with the interdigitated-back-contacted (IBC) architecture, it enables the highest efficient, 26.7%, single junction c-Si solar cell. However, the mass production of such high efficient solar cells is limited, due to the complexity of the solar cell processes and the involved expensive TCO layer(s). The objective of this thesis is to develop high efficiency, simple processed IBC-SHJ solar cells. To accomplish this goal, a comprehensive study ‘from layer to device’ is conducted: firstly, the focus is on the contact stacks deposited via PECVD, which includes intrinsic and doped hydrogenated amorphous silicon (a-Si:H) and nanocrystalline silicon oxide (nc-SiOx:H) thin-film layers; Then the optimized passivation contact stacks are used in the front back contacted (FBC) solar cells, with which the factors that limit the fill factor (FF) and open-circuit voltage (VOC) are identified; Lastly, a simplified process is developed to fabricate tunneling IBC-SHJ solar cells. The influences of PECVD deposition parameters on passivation quality and carrier selectivity of the passivation and contact layer stacks were intensively studied. With the optimized 6 nm thick intrinsic a-Si:H layer an effective lifetime over 3 ms and implied-VOC (iVOC) beyond 720 mV are achieved on double side textured c-Si. Enhanced passivation qualities with iVOC of 729 mV is obtained by adding the field effect passivation from the optimized n-type a-Si:H and nc-SiOx:H layers on top of the excellent chemical passivation induced by the optimized 10 nm thick intrinsic a-Si:H layer. On the other hand, with the optimized intrinsic a-Si:H passivation layer, the deposition of p-type a-Si:H or nc-SiOx:H does not deteriorate the overall passivation quality. Besides that the optimized p-type nc-SiOx:H layer exhibits excellent activation energy of 51.4 meV, which closes to the optimal value for a high efficient hole selectivity, and a dark conductivity of 0.174 S/cm, which is high enough to facilitate the hole transport. Research on FBC-SHJ solar cells reveals that thicker p-type nc-SiOx:H layer is essential to ensure a smaller/no drop from SunsVoc to VOC, which is related to minority carrier collection. Besides, such a thick doped nc-SiOx:H layers can effectively shield the device precursor from the influence of ITO’s field effect and keep the overall passivation quality after ITO sputtering. Accordingly, the best FBC device shows promising results in terms of SunsVoc with 727 mV and 734 mV, pFF of 0.862 and 0.841, measured before and after metallization, respectively. By implementing 3 nm n-type nc-Si:H instead of directly n-type nc-SiOx:H in contact with ITO, FF improves from 0.56 to 0.73. The best manufactured FBC-SHJ solar cell (7.84 cm2) exhibits VOC of 710 mV, EQE short-circuit current density (JSC,EQE) of 39.4 mA/cm2, FF of 0.73 and efficiency of 20.4%. For IBC-SHJ solar cells manufacture, the lift-off patterning approach is proved to be not suitable for processing double side textured cells, mainly due to the fact that the doped nc-SiOx thin film alloys is not HF resistant. However, by applying this non-HF resistant property of the doped nc-SiOx alloys, a novel wet-chemical approach for processing tunneling IBC-SHJ solar cell is developed. This patterning approach allows to simplify the process. And the tunneling structure avoids the patterning step of the p-type nc-SiOx:H layer. The first preliminary IBC device demonstrated with this approach exhibits VOC of 659 mV, JSC of 41.30 mA/cm2, FF of 0.67, and efficiency of 18.2%. Further optimization on the thickness of the intrinsic a-Si:H layers induces an excellent VOC of 719 mV with an average VOC of 715 mV over 7 cells, JSC over 41 mA/cm2. However, the low FF (&lt;0.60) is limiting the cells performance, which is mainly attribute to the low conductivity of the n-type nc-SiOx:H layers.","photovoltaic; heterojunction; solar cell; passivation; contact stack","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2019-08-01","","","","","",""

[1] This document illustrates the commitment of the IMO to significantly reduce the emission of greenhouse gasses (GHG) from international shipping in coming decades. However, the question arises whether the ambitious goals, set out in this press release, are feasible to be met. <br/><br/>This aim of this thesis is to investigate the economic and technological feasibility of powering a vessel while emitting minimal greenhouse gasses in 2050. The focus will be on power plant configuration consisting of an energy storage medium and energy converter. A case study, concerning a representative ROPAX ferry built in 2050, is performed to illustrate the feasibility of using such a power plant configuration.<br/><br/>Energy storage media considered are hydrogen, ammonia and batteries. The use of internal combustion engines, fuel cells and an ammonia reformer are also investigated. The performance of power plant configurations with respect to their estimated greenhouse gas emission, overall weight, required volume, initial investment cost and cost of the required energy per day of operation is evaluated and based on the results of this study several conclusions are drawn. <br/><br/>• First and foremost is the need to reduce the price difference of hydrogen and ammonia compared to LNG. Without this reduction, no single synthetic fuel can be considered economically feasible. Three options to reduce the price difference are identified: <br/>- a high LNG price including high emission tax;<br/>- a low commercial electric energy price; or<br/>- synthetic fuel production using excess renewable energy.<br/>Especially the last of these three is considered to be a feasible measure due to the expected presence of excess energy from solar and wind farms. <br/>• The second conclusion is that using fuel cells or batteries are the most environmentally friendly option due to the emission of N2O when using internal combustion engines.<br/>• Thirdly, all sustainable configurations require a considerable amount of space.<br/>• Furthermore, the combination of relative low electrical efficiencies and high hydrogen price result in high daily costs for hydrogen fueled internal combustion engines and PEMFCs.<br/>• The initial investment cost and system weight of batteries-based configurations are high. <br/><br/>Following these conclusions, only three power plant configurations remain. Based on expected safety and logistical concerns and the expected potential for improvements, a single configuration was determined to be the most suitable to be used on a ROPAX ferry in 2050. This power plant configuration is composed of a SOFC directly fueled by ammonia.<br/><br/>After assessing the safety concerns associated with handling ammonia and the implications the established power plant configuration has on the general arrangement of the ship, it is concluded that the use of such a power plant configuration is highly likely to be feasible in 2050. However, it is recommended to perform a more in-depth analysis of required safety measures and operating characteristics of fuel cells in future research.<br","Hydrogen; Ammonia; Fuel Cell; ROPAX; Batteries; Ferry; GHG; Greenhouse gas; Emissions; Power plant","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2019-06-20","","","","","",""

A suitable design for such a robot would be that of a torque-controllable quadrupedal manipulator. Its capability for legged locomotion enables high mobility, specifically on rough terrain, while its quadrupedal morphology provides a relatively large and stable base of support compared to bipedal robots. Torque-controlled joints allow for safer and more controllable interaction with the environment. <br/><br/>For such a system a challenge lies in the design of a controller that actually achieves the promising capabilities for locomotion and manipulation that the mechanical system offers. One of the currently most promising control frameworks for this purpose is that of hierarchical inverse dynamics. This real-time whole-body control framework allows for dynamic whole-body motions and compliant interaction with the environment while enforcing a strict priority between the desired control tasks. Although promising results have previously been attained with such controllers, it has not yet been applied for the control of a quadrupedal manipulator. The focus of this thesis is on the implementation of a hierarchical inverse dynamics controller for the control of a simulated quadrupedal manipulator, with a particular focus on the design of prioritized sets of control tasks which generate forms of stationary whole-body manipulation. <br/><br/>First a basic set of prioritized control tasks is presented, which is shown to satisfy the robot's most crucial control requirements. Subsequently three extended sets of control tasks are presented, which result in additional desirable emergent behavior of the robot. The first one of these depends on the inclusion of kinematic joint limit tasks to prevent kinematic singularities and self-collision, and to trigger whole-body reaching motion. Secondly a set of tasks is presented which is focused on utilizing motion of some of the torso's degrees of freedom to optimize the arm's posture according to a posture-related cost function. Thirdly a set of tasks is presented which enables contact force control at the end-effector for force-based manipulation. In addition to this final set of tasks, a higher-level controller is presented which detects external forces acting on the robot and computes a desired shift of the position of the robot's center of mass in order to mitigate the balance-disturbing effects of external forces. All of the presented sets of tasks do not exclude each other and allow to be implemented simultaneously in order to combine the individual benefits that they offer.<br/><br/>The results of this research project show that hierarchical inverse dynamics control can be successfully applied for the control of a simulated torque-controllable quadrupedal manipulator. Moreover, it is shown that well-designed sets of prioritized control tasks allow for emergent whole-body behaviors which exploit the advantages that both the robotic system and the control framework offer. Future work will need to investigate the transferability of these results to a physical robot.","Whole-body Control; Hierarchical Inverse Dynamics; Mobile Manipulation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2018-12-10","","","","","",""

This is done in order to gain in-depth knowledge on how the development of the Dutch meat substitute innovations system could be further fostered. The data presented is delivered primarily from expert interviews conducted among 14 actors connected to the field of meat substitution between November 2017 and May 2018. In terms of multilevel perspective, it was revealed that the meat production and consumption regime does not actively try to undermine the raising meat substitution niches, but rather obstruct their development by the deeply embedded rules and structures of the regime that it seems to be unwilling to change. As the landscape pressures of rising environmental concern, rising concern over animal welfare, changing health perceptions and quest for culinary novelty offer only soft pressure to the regime, the meat production, and consumption regime has time to reconfigure itself and adopt innovation from the meat substitute niches in a symbiotic manner. Due to this, the transition pathway that meat substitution is currently taking in the Netherlands is that of reconfiguration. The functioning of the innovation system was determined to be especially good in terms of entrepreneurial activities and knowledge development, and the greatest single bottleneck was detected in the functioning of market formation by the government. Investigation of the expectations of the producers of meat substitutes revealed that the expectations relating to social practices and technologies are especially diverse, due to which the actors develop varying strategies for operation. These varying expectations have likely results in the abundance of niches within the system. Based on the results of the analysis on functional dynamics, eight recommendations were given for action to foster the development of the system.","sustainability; Innovation system functions; Innovation diffusion; food production","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Industrial Ecology","",""

To test or design a levee an adequate amount of soil investigation is required to indicate the presence of different soil types, stratification and to estimate the relevant soil parameters. The spatial spreading and the fact that the number of cone penetration tests (CPT) and boreholes within a levee to determine geotechnical parameters and stratification are limited, means that the estimated parameters always contain uncertainties. Nevertheless current guidelines do not cover the minimum CPT interval size or the uncertainty in undrained shear strength in longitudinal direction. In this thesis it is analysed how the quantity of CPTs in longitudinal direction affect the estimated undrained shear strength, and how this influences the probability of failure regarding inner slope stability. <br/><br/>A 5 km long levee containing a continuous peat and clay layer along the Markermeer is specified as research area. In this area the CPT interval size in longitudinal direction is 100 m. The inner slope stability is analysed with D-Geo Stability (level I reliability approach) and the Probabilistic Toolkit (level II reliability approach). Although simplifications within the model ensure that only layer thickness and undrained shear strength vary in longitudinal direction, the calculated safety factors still show a lot of fluctuation. The probabilistic stability analysis show that in the considered research area, the undrained shear strength has a larger influence on the probability of failure in comparison to layer thickness, unit weight and outside water level.<br/><br/>As the CPT interval size increases in longitudinal direction, the minimum safety factor could be overseen, which can lead to optimistic reliability estimations. The theory of information entropy is used to analyse the effect of changing CPT interval sizes on the estimation of the undrained shear strength. Information entropy measures the amount of uncertainty/information in a dataset. A new partial factor (the ‘spatial factor’) is proposed based on the normalized entropy. The proposed spatial factor accounts for spatial uncertainty in the estimated undrained shear strength in longitudinal direction and assigns additional safety when the CPT interval size is larger than 100 m for the considered research area. This methodology promotes the collection of additional data, which is thought to be the basic starting point for any partial factor that is assigned to cover epistemic uncertainties.<br","Inner slope stability; CPT; Undrained shear strength; Information Entropy","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","","52.467875, 5.034111"

While the threat posed by storm surges has been greatly reduced since the implementation of the Deltaworks, riverine areas in the west of the country are characterised by the highest risk of flooding.<br/>The use of relief wells is one of the viable solutions to improve the safety of river embankments against instability mechanisms such as uplifting. Throughout the Schoonhovenseveer-Langerak project (SLA), the implementation of a system of relief wells constituted one of the key measures to increase the safety of the embankment structure during high-water events of the river Lek. In the current study, the influence of relief wells was simulated employing a 3D coupled model built with the Finite Element software PLAXIS 3D. Using soil properties from former site investigations, a calibration was performed based on in situ pore water pressure measurements, in order to devise adequate boundary conditions. The safety assessment of the structure was then performed by applying a time-dependent high-water wave and employing strength reduction to yield a Factor of Safety. An intermediate 2D model was employed to examine the evolution in time of the Factor of Safety, the influence of mesh refinement on the safety results, and the shape and the location of the failure mechanism. By means of the 3D model, different design choices of the system of relief wells were tested and their influence on the stability of the structure and on the water discharge could be determined. A comparison between the results obtained in the 2D and 3D models showed that a 3D stability analysis does not necessarily yield a less conservative result than the 2D equivalent.<br/>Comparing the values of the Factor of Safety obtained with time-dependent and stationary boundary conditions showed that the results obtained in the latter case are considerably more conservative, suggesting the potential benefits of a time-dependent fully-coupled analysis.","Embankment; Plaxis; Stability; Relief well; Finite elements","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2020-01-01","","","","","",""

To separate the NOx emissions from drilling and extraction, a multiple linear regression to the NO2 columns as a function of time is calculated for 9 extraction regions using the number of drilling rigs and the oil and gas extraction data from 2007 until 2018. In 3 regions (Permian, Bakken, Eagle Ford) a significant correlation between measured and modeled NO2 columns is found, of which the Permian region shows the highest correlation. The analysis shows that half of the total NOx emissions in the Permian region can be attributed to emissions from oil and gas activities, and that both the drilling and extraction activities have an equal share in the emissions. A fuel-based oil and gas emission inventory shows a different split for NOx emissions from drilling and extraction in the Permian region, indicating drilling as the larger source. In other extraction regions, NO2 columns show poor correlation with the oil and gas activities due to the proximity of urban areas (Barnett, Denver-Julesburg, Haynesville regions), power plants (San Juan) or variations in the drilling and extraction activity over time that are too small (Uintah, Upper Green River).","NOx; Emissions; oil; gas; pollution; Satellite; Remote Sensing","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2019-06-01","","","","","",""

Numerical models are extensively used to make these predictions. In these models it is fundamental to have proper values for bed roughness. The bed roughness is being estimated using a dataset from an ongoing pilot project in the Dutch western Wadden Sea. This dataset consists of 40 days of velocity measurements using ADV (8 Hz) and ADCP (1 Hz) instruments and concentration of SPM measurements using OBS instruments.<br/>To estimate the bed roughness, the dataset is analyzed using four methods for calculating the bed shear stress. The logarithmic profile, turbulent kinetic energy, vertical turbulent kinetic energy and the Reynolds stress method.<br/><br/>The data has been processed and averaged per tidal phase, so statistical analysis can be applied to it. From this analysis, it is found that the concentration of SPM increases at 6 cm with increasing wind speed. As a result of this increasing of SPM the bed roughness also increases. This leads to the hypothesis that suspended sediment makes the bed rougher, and is not primarily governed by horizontal advection but also local resuspension.<br/>A 1DV numerical model is used in which horizontal advection is excluded to test this hypothesis.<br/><br/>Simulations are performed with stationary boundary conditions, using combinations of water depth (0.2 to 2.8 m) and velocities (5 cm/s to 70 cm/s). These simulations are imposed with an initial homogeneous concentration. For every combination, the concentration is increased gradually until the concentration profile becomes L-shaped.<br/><br/>Besides simulations with stationary conditions, timeseries of water depth and velocity are used to simulate one tidal cycle.<br/>All simulations performed with this numerical model do not take wind and waves into account and water-bed exchange is excluded.<br/>From the simulations with stationary boundary conditions the roughness is calculated using the LP method. It is found that bed roughness increases with increasing initial homogeneous concentration.<br/><br/>From the simulation of one tidal cycle, it is found that the roughness increases towards the turn of the tide. After the turning of the tide, the concentration profile becomes L-shaped, and the roughness is decreased. The concentration profile becomes homegeneous again after a certain threshold of velocity and waterdepth and at the same time the roughness increases again. During a tidal cycle, it is possible to have a collapsed concentration profile, which indicates a lower bed roughness and thus a smoother bed.","bed roughness; fluid mud; 1dv numeric model; bed shear stress methods; roughness length","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","Mud motor project","53.25510, 5.50258"

(mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2018","Currently, 54% of the general population lives in urban areas. This number is estimated to increase to 66% by 2050. Urbanization is generally linked to several phenomena that are detrimental to the overall quality of life; the urban heat island effect, and the decrease of air quality due to pollutants. The addition of vegetation to urban areas is generally seen as the best measure to combat these phenomena, due to their suggested filtering and cooling capacity. Currently, both phenomena are studied as separate processes, but research suggest that the cooling power of vegetation is linked to the amount of pollution that is present. This calls for a numerical implementation that is able to accurately model both the filtering, and cooling effect such that the interplay between them can be studied in the future. In this work, an existing RANS k− solver is extended with the dry-deposition model to deter-mine the filtering capacity of the vegetation, and the leaf energy balance model to determine the cooling effect of the vegetation. Using the dry deposition model, we were able to accurately reproduce experimental measurements of the filtering capacity of a hawthorn hedge in an open field, obtained by Tiwary et al. [2006]. We assumed that the filtering took place due to both needle-like and broad leaf collectors. The same case was studied byˇS ́ıp and Beneˇs [2016], who obtained similar results, but used a different mixing parameters of the collector types. We concluded that additional studies are needed to determine the importance of the collector mixing parameters for multiple species, before the dry deposition model can be considered as valid. Using the leaf energy balance model, we were able to determine the cooling power of a simple vegetation block, exactly reproducing the results obtained by [Manickathan et al., 2017]. Using the leaf energy balance model, we were not able to reproduce experimental measurements of the leaf temperature of potted impatiens, obtained by [Kichah et al., 2012]. This was caused by the nature of the flow, which proved to be barely turbulent and outside of the scope of our RANSk− solver. We concluded that the leaf energy balance model needs to tested against other experimental measurements, obtained under different flow conditions. As of yet, we cannot determine if the model is able to accurately reproduce experimental measurements.","CFD; Vegetation Flow; Navier-Stokes; Turbulence; Dry-deposition; Transpiration","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2020-06-18","","","","Applied Physics","Transport Phenomena and Fluid Flow",""

One of the latest products from Stinis is the Split-Headblock. This device allows its user to work in tandem operation in which up to two 20ft or four 40ft containers can be lifted at once. In order to further increase the performance, it is important that it can be accurately positioned. Due to wind, trolley driving, and possibly other factors, the Split-Headblock starts to skew. This motion makes it very difficult to enter a cell on a ship or place the containers onto truck trailers. Reducing the skewing motions can therefore increase the cranes performance. Several attempts have already been made to control this motion from the crane. This research proposes a method to control the skewing motion from the headblock. A solution is proposed where horizontally movable sheaves are controlled with a PID controller to control the system. Tests are performed with a Simulink Simscape simulation model. The solution has been tested on a variety of load cases, hoisting heights and external disturbances. Out of the 124 cases tested, 86 showed a successful outcome where the anti-skew system is an improvement compared to not using the system. Taking all results into account, the anti-skew-system can improve the number of MPH and total throughput up to 6% in least favourable conditions and up to 17% in most favourable conditions.","anti-skew; crane; control; STS","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2038-06-18","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Transport Engineering and Logistics","",""

(mentor); van Timmeren, A. (mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution); Universiteit Leiden (degree granting institution)","2018","Large material flows are extracted from natural mines in the earth’s crust and moved and stored in anthropogenic environments. Extraction processes from natural mines are often harmful for the environment and can cause material scarcity. At the same time governments are formulating ambitions to increase circularity in cities. For these reasons the concept urban mining is becoming increasingly interesting: the process of analysing and recovering or reusing materials from the city. There is still a lot to explore before steps can be taken to implement urban mining. For a lot of materials, data is missing on quantities and precise locations. This research proposes a method to localize material quantities, for estimating the potential of the material mine of a city. This is done with a case study for copper stock dynamics in Amsterdam between 2018 and 2050. Material Flow Analyses up until now seem to have been effective for analysing material stocks and flows in cities. Geographic Information Systems are used for all kinds of geographic research. With a combination of the two, stock dynamics of copper between 2018 and 2050 are modelled on a detailed level. The copper stocks are distinguished on basis of use in the city: buildings, infrastructure, transportation and appliances. Firstly, the current stock density is estimated, resulting in an amount of 150 kilograms of copper per capita, and visualised in a density map. The map demonstrates a high copper density in the centre, and a low density the further away from the centre. Then, the future stock dynamics are modelled. The resulting stock comes down to about 167 kilograms per capita. An energy transition scenario is modelled on top of the model, to gain insights of the impact of the energy transition on the copper stock. This led to an increase of 7%. The stock expands, mainly to areas in around the centre. Several socio-economic variables seem to correlate with the distribution of the copper mine: floor area density and projected population growth. The outcome of the model can be useful for improving logistics of secondary material outflows. The outcome can also support decision making for policy measures that influence the demand of materials that are potentially scarce (such as subsidizing of solar panels). The method was labour and data intensive, python knowledge would be recommended in the future. Another important recommendation is to start a collaboration for a sound database that can be used for prospecting urban mines.","Urban Mining; Circular Economy; urban metabolism; Material Flow Analysis; Geographic Information Systems; dynamic stock model","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Industrial Ecology","","52.3702157, 4.895167899999933"

Demand change was incorporated as individual consumers allocating their budgets with a utility function. A recursive utility function based on the notions of prospect theory was implemented with which consumers allocated their budget over several sectors. For technological change both incremental change was incorporated by implementing the Wright curve, and innovation was incorporated which can be modelled with general evolutionary algorithms.

An Al2O3 layer is used to passivate the Mo/CIGS rear surface which also prevents the NPs from completely dissolving into the absorber during the absorber deposition. The implementation of all these rear-surface modifications and their impact on the electrical performance of the CIGS solar cell will be discussed and analyzed in this paper.

One of the major design challenges is the selection of a powering method that could supply mW power levels to miniaturized implanted devices. Among several methods, wireless power transfer is often used to directly supply the electronics or to recharge an implanted battery. In particular, the interest in ultrasonic waves as source of power and data for implantable medical devices has recently grown, particularly due to the advantages over RF and inductive coupling power transfer. In fact, ultrasounds can deliver higher power to mm-sized and deeply (&gt; 10 cm) implanted receivers than the other techniques. Moreover, acoustic waves do not interfere with electromagnetic fields.Conventionally, biphasic constant current or constant voltage pulses are selected for stimulating nerve tissue. The first (usually cathodic) phase has the purpose of activating the excitable nerve fibres, while the second (usually anodic) phase reverses the direction of the stimulation current to avoid long-term accumulation of charge. Alternatively, Ultra-High-Frequency stimulation can be employed. This consists of current or voltage pulses at a high frequency (≥ 1 MHz), which are obtained from a DC source and the operation of high-frequency switches. In both techniques, when a wireless supply is chosen, the received AC signal is rectified, stored and regulated to operate the usually low-voltage blocks of the rest of the system. Nonetheless, up-conversion of the signal is often required to provide enough voltage compliance to operate an output stage connected to the stimulating electrodes.Taking a more radical approach, it is possible to avoid the lossy conversion from AC to regulated DC and from that to high-frequency stimulation by eliminating the need of power storage, regulation and up-conversion. To this end, the aim of this work was to design a circuit topology that generates ultra-high-frequency pulses by rectifying the sinusoid obtained from an ultrasound transducer and using the obtained waveform to directly stimulate the tissue in a biphasic fashion. This could result in a highly efficient and miniature circuit, which has the potential to be used for stimulating small peripheral nerves. Simulations in LTSpice were conducted to analyse the performance of the proposed system. The operation was then verified by measurements with a fabricated prototype, which was capable of providing biphasic pulses by receiving a signal from ultrasound piezoelectric transducers and driving a pair of electrodes.","ultrasound; neurostimulator; biphasic electrical stimulation; ultra-high-frequency","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2020-06-01","","","","","",""

Normally, offshore installation companies receive a subsidy for building offshore wind farms, but due to multiple companies bidding to install for lower and lower subsidies, the point where wind farms are installed without subsidy has been reached. Therefore, companies have to install wind farms as efficient as possible. Since logistics are a major contributor to costs during the installation of an offshore wind farm, Van Oord and Deltares are doing research methods to solve logistic and scheduling problems. In this thesis, research is done in algorithms to solve two typical planning problems which arise during the installation of offshore wind farms: The Component Relocation Problem (CRP) and the Ship Installation Routing Problem (SIRP).<br/><br/><br/>In the CRP, the storage and movement of turbine components in the harbour is considered. The crane operator manages the storage yard to fulfil a schedule of arriving and departing components. Since access of a storage location by crane can be hindered due to surrounding components, placement and relocation of components such that the requested component is accessible at the requested time, is a challenge. This challenge is solved in the component relocation problem, while minimizing the amount of relocations carried out by the crane.<br/><br/>\medskip<br/>A Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) model is developed for this problem, along with an improved formulation to increase the solver performance and solve small instances to optimality.

To install a turbine, multiple components have to be transported to the required locations, where they will be installed by multiple ships. While creating an installation schedule, it is desired to both minim the travelling time for ships, as the time ships are waiting on other ships and objects. An MILP for this scheduling problem is given, which models this problem as a Vehicle Routing Problem, with extensions to account for installation by multiple vehicles and time synchronization. Furthermore, to solve larger problems, an Adaptive Iterative Simulated Annealing (AISA) algorithm is developed.<br/><br/><br/>The heuristic methods were validated against the exact methods and for small instances the heuristic methods were able to replicate the optimal solutions. The heuristic algorithms provided decisions in less than 12 hours, a relatively short time in comparison to installation times for offshore wind turbines. The AISA was able to create a schedule which drastically decreased the synchronization conflicts in a real world installation project. Although the sailing distance increased in comparison with the original planning, it was improved compared to the executed route. Furthermore, for the same project, the crane routing optimisation led to a reduction of 55% based on non-essential crane actions.<br","Optimisation; Offshore; scheduling; Crane","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Two models with spacing of 3 times the diameter of root and 6 times the diameter of the root were prepared to study the effect of spacing on load transfer mechanism. A model with no reinforcement (fallow) has also been tested. During the test, load was introduced to a foundation at the crest of slope till the slope failed. It was observed that as the spacing increases, load bearing capacity of slopes decreases. As spacing of roots decreases, incidence of failure prolongs. Also, as the spacing of roots decreases, shear failure plane gets deeper in the slope.

Extensive research has been dedicated to direct-following lateral control methods, using a single preview point as reference signal. However, these methods give rise to significant tracking errors. As alternative to a single point, a continuous path can be used as reference signal for vehicle control. Using a continuous reference path, accurate and comfortable control actions can be computed, while avoiding reference tracking errors. Therefore, robust reference path generation is an essential part of lateral vehicle control.<br/><br/>The goal of this research is to develop a generic, robust reference path generator for lateral vehicle control. Currently in path generation, the state-of-the-art method is based on repetitive polynomial fitting. This method inherently contains two main weaknesses. Firstly, it is not robust to sensor noise and other real-world disturbances. Secondly, as a result of the repetitive fitting, a discontinuous path is generated. This is undesirable, because it leads to an unfeasible reference path, since vehicles can only produce and track continuous trajectories. Moreover, a discontinuous reference path results in the need for path smoothing when used in comfortable lateral vehicle control. Fundamentally, this smoothing leads to inaccurate control, caused by manipulation of the original, discontinuous reference path. To overcome these weaknesses, a new Model-based Path Generation method is presented.<br/><br/>The development of a new, generic method for robust path generation is the main contribution of this research. This new path generation method is capable of producing feasible vehicle trajectories based on unfeasible waypoints. The performance of this method is evaluated in simulations and experiments, benchmarking it against polynomial fitting path generation. Furthermore, path generation robustness is assessed based on the outcome of a disturbance sensitivity analysis. The results are in accordance with the hypothesis stating that the new method outperforms the benchmark method in terms of path accuracy, robustness, continuity, and general applicability.","robust; path generation; vehicle control","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2020-06-15","","","","","",""

This could be explained by their complex multi-scale (anisotropic) hard-soft material structure, starting at a nano-scale. The interest in the fabrication of complex biomimetic hard-soft materials and interfaces is growing due to their high fracture properties, including stiffness, strength and fracture toughness. Additive manufacturing, in particular voxel-based additive manufacturing, enables the precise mimicking of complex natural three-dimensional (3D) structures at a micro-scale. Various studies have been performed on the fabrication of biomimetic materials with an Objet500 Connex3 polyjet printer which is able to print multiple materials at the same time. However, fundamental research on the influence of multiple biomimetic design parameters on the fracture properties of hard-soft materials was missing. <br/>In this study the isolated and modulated effects of three different biomimetic design parameters on the fracture properties of hard-soft material samples were analysed. The samples differed in length scale (40, 240, 480 and 960 µm), hard material ratio (0, 25, 38, 50, 63, 75 and 100 %) and hard-soft material arrangement (semi-ordered, random and ordered). These design parameters could be found among different natural materials and interfaces. The fracture properties of the single edge notched samples, including stiffness, fracture strength, final strain and fracture toughness, were obtained with a tensile test. The effect of the different design parameters on the fracture properties was further analysed with digital image correlation (DIC) measurements and a digital microscope. <br/>The results show that the biomimetic design parameters had a modulated effect on the fracture properties. The fracture properties were mostly affected by the hard material ratio and length scale compared to the hard-soft material arrangement. A higher amount of hard material resulted in a higher stiffness and fracture strength, but in a smaller final strain. A smaller length scale improved the fracture properties if a significant amount of soft material was present. An important result is that the fracture toughness of the hard-soft material samples could be increased by nearly two times compared to the toughness of the individual constituents, supporting the potential of using biomimetic design parameters. The effect of the biomimetic design parameters on the fracture properties can be explained by the DIC measurements and digital microscope images. The microscope images show that the fracture path tended to propagate through the soft material phases, which was more difficult at a smaller length scale. DIC measurements showed that the plasticity zone in front of the crack tip was larger for the samples printed at native resolution, resulting in a higher fracture toughness. <br/>This study shows that a wide range of fracture properties can be achieved by regulating the length scale, hard material ratio and hard-soft material arrangement of hard-soft materials. The fracture toughness of hard-soft materials can be improved in comparison to the fracture toughness of the individual constituents, which supports the potential of using biomimetic design parameters in improving the fracture properties of hard-soft materials.","Biomimetic materials; Fracture properties; Length scale; Hard material ratio; Hard-soft material arrangement; Voxel-based additive manufacturing","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2019-06-14","","","","","",""

In addition to this, due to climate change, several areas are experiencing extended periods of heavy rainfall and serious droughts, resulting in an increasing water problem in many cities. <br/>A major challenge is to find a good balance between measures preventing an overload of rainwater leading to urban flooding and providing a solution for times when there is a scarcity of water, which currently result in unwanted effects like restrictions for water use. <br/><br/>The Dakdokters is a company that works on a solution for these problems using an underused place, rooftops. Their core business is designing and installing green roofs in order to increase the benefits of greenery in cities. In 2013 they realized that their green roofs could maybe be combined with an open water storage system that could serve as a water buffer. This was the start of a project called “Polder Roof” (polderdak). <br/>The Polder Roof makes use of a WRB (Water Retention Box) layer underneath a green roof. Large amounts of rainwater which would normally be discharged in the sewage system, are temporarily stored in these boxes on the roof. This not only reduces the pressure on the sewage system during periods of heavy rainfall, but the stored water can subsequently be used for e.g. irrigation of the green roof, or for applications like toilet flushing, leading to a decrease in the use of high quality tap water. Technically it is necessary to be able to precisely control the amounts of water stored. This is achieved by a semi-automatic system, called the Smart Flow Control (SFC), which uses various sensors and electric actuation for control. In addition, it can be controlled over the internet by external operators. <br/><br/>Assignment <br/>Currently several prototypes of SFC controlled Polder roofs are installed on 7 different rooftops in Amsterdam. These prototypes function as a proof of concept. However, for the final market implementation some parts of the concept need improvement: <br/>First of all there is the costs aspect. In order to be competitive with other water retention solutions, the Polder Roof should become less expensive per m3 of water storage. A decrease in investment costs as well as in the yearly costs of maintenance and data subscriptions are needed. <br/>Secondly, the current products fail too often, leading to high maintenance costs. <br/>Thirdly, although not important when it comes to functionality, the design of the system must be aesthetically pleasing, especially in cases where the green roof is going to be combined rooftop park-like settings on the rooftop, visited by e.g. personnel of companies.<br/><br/>The assignment of the Dakdokters for the project described here, focused foremost on the design of the regulatory valve and its housing. In the course of the project the rest of the system was also analysed to identify any other optimizations needed. <br/><br/>The outcome of the project can be divided in the following analyses and results: <br/><br/>Step 1: Exploring the context<br/>The input of different stakeholders was obtained in interviews, especially with a view to critically assess the wanted functionalities of the Polder Roof, since a reduction in these could possibly result in a less complex product, reduced parts costs and increased reliability due to less parts that could fail. Not just the market context, but also the technological implications of the roof context was analysed. <br/><br/>Step 2: Analysis of the current product<br/>All current parts were critically analysed with respect to their functionality, costs and reliability. The reliability analysis not only comprised to regular wear through usage, but also to sensitivity to external factors, such as water pollution. These analyses corroborated the idea that the biggest improvements could be made by redesigning the valve and housing of the SFC, concomitantly also improving the installation procedure. The latter is important since in many cases multiple SFC’s need to be placed , due to the fact that roofs are never totally flat but have a slight slope, requiring multiple basins , each with their own SFC for the optimal water storage. Therefore I first concentrated on redesigning the valve and its housing.<br/><br/>Step 3: Analysis of the current product<br/>These analyses led to a personal design vision of the full system. Together with a function map that was checked by the company and its most important partner, Optigroen, this resulted in a complete overview of all desired functionalities of the new Polder Roof and a program of requirements. <br/><br/>Step 4: Product development of the valve and the housing. <br/>Multiple brainstorm sessions resulted in several new ideas, which were evaluated in expert meetings, using prototypes and (CAD)-sketches. I designed a new way of operating the valve, using a rotational actuator. The expensive, non-functional and not very aesthetically pleasing windmill shape of the current housing was simplified into a droplet shape, making it cheaper to produce while still being iconic. This housing was optimized for easy manufacturing and installation and improved safety of the system. These concepts were bundled into a final new concept.<br/><br/>Step 5: Embodying the concept<br/>In the final design phase the concept was further embodied. Several optimizations using tests with a full scale prototype and meetings with experts led to final concept of the SFC which is focused on an easy and cost-effective production and installation process. A concept for the parts needed for the connectivity of all SFC’s on the roof, using a new micro-controller, reducing the investment and yearly costs and a new scenario for the software using rain radar data was designed. <br/><br/>Step 6: Evaluation of the new product. <br/>In the final phase an evaluation was done on the functionality, the reliability, the costs and the aesthetics of the new design. These evaluation proved that a the new design is less expensive, easier to install on different types of roofs, easy to maintain and more reliable. In addition, it proved aesthetically pleasing to the stakeholders.<br/>Apart from these conclusions the results of these evaluations led to recommendations for further development of the SFC, of which the most important is the following: In order to accurately test the new design it is necessary to built a full size test set up with which roof conditions can be simulated. This set-up should including multiple variations in roof lay-out and amount of water storage. It can similarly act as a demonstration model","Polder roofs; Dakdokters; Polderdak; Water retention; Water storage; Green roof; Blue roof; Sustainabilty; Climate-proof","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","","","","Integrated Product Design","",""

Over 700 universities offer a total of 5924 MOOCs. Each MOOC holds a sequence of 10 to 140 videos and are meant to help online learners understand a given topic. These videos are intended to be watched in a specific, sequential order. This order can be seen as a chain where video 1 provides enough prerequisite knowledge for video 2, video 2 for video 3 and so on. In theory that is fine, however, this order is not necessarily the only ideal order to watch videos in. The online learner might want to take shortcuts through the MOOC's videos, find additional information on the topic in another video or explore what other subjects are available to study. In other words, the online learner could benefit from improved navigational features to better explore the surrounding relevant videos. By branching out the viewing order towards videos in other MOOCs, we add alternative sequence orders as possible learning paths for the online learner. This can help online learners plan out an alternative sequence order based on their own interests and backgrounds. The chain-like sequence order as described above, where one video provides the prerequisite knowledge for its successor, is crucial for creating alternative sequence orders. When video 1 from MOOC A is found to be similar to video 5 from MOOC B, it can be assumed that video 1 provides the prerequisite knowledge for video 6 in MOOC B. Similar videos between the MOOCs are found by comparing their transcripts, titles and durations. Based on this similarity a new sequence order is set up from one video to its similar counterparts’ successor video. We structure these alternative sequence orders by representing the videos from MOOCs as nodes into a graph and connect them with directed edges that represent the sequence order between videos. Several methods for finding similarities have been compared to find the most accurate way of comparing transcriptions where the method doc2vec yields the most accurate similarity cases. Evaluation based on a user study shows that our method creates alternative sequence orders that have 58.7% positive user ratings. This can be compared to semi-randomly picked sequence orders and the original sequence order defined in the MOOC, which have 8.0% and 76% positive user ratings respectively. This shows that the alternative sequence orders are significantly better than the semi-randomly picked sequence orders, and comparable but not as good as the original sequence order defined in the MOOC.","MOOCs; Document similarity; doc2vec","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In a project based on knowledge from leisure crafting, the following assignment has been formulated: “design a product and/or service to encourage people to engage in creative leisure, in order to reach personal goals and improve their subjective well-being.”<br/><br/>To solve this design problem, different aspects of creative leisure were explored through literature review and user research. The resulting insights were translated into themes indicating opportunities for design. The theme of Creative confidence was selected to continue with.<br/><br/>After several rounds of ideation, two concepts emerge. Feedback from creative hobbyists and insights from literature are used to choose one concept: CreativiTijd.<br/><br/>CreativiTijd is a pendulum clock that reminds its users to engage in a creative hobby for fifteen minutes at a time. This reminder comes three times per week in the form of mischievous behaviour, with pendulums swinging chaotically. The user can then put the clock to rest by sliding out the CreativiTijd part of the clock and taking time for their creative hobby. In this way, the pendulum clock makes creative hobbyists more aware of their choices for their spare time.<br/><br/>A final user evaluation with a detailed prototype reveals that it is likely that CreativiTijd achieves its aim of encouraging people to engage more in their creative hobby.

The Nga Moe Yeik Creek (a tributary of the Yangon River) is closed off at the upstream end during the dry season and is subject to high siltation rates. Extensive dredging is necessary to ensure navigability. However, dredging activities stopped in 2015 because dredging appeared to be insufficient.<br/><br/>Flushing the creek, by opening the Nga Moe Yeik Creek Sluice Gates more often could contribute to a solution to minimise the siltation rates, leading to lowered dredging volumes and an improved navigability of the creek. However, it may decrease the availability of irrigation and drinking water behind the sluice in the dry season. The responsible authorities are looking for an optimal solution. The current insight in the siltation problem is limited due to a lack of measured data collected in the Nga Moe Yeik Creek. The general consensus is that siltation rates can be decreased by an improved operating scheme of the Nga Moe Yeik Sluice Gates.<br/><br/>Since data resources are scarce or not available at all, data on bathymetry, water levels and suspended sediment concentration is collected from the field between May and July 2017. The observed water levels show a flood-dominant tidal wave with a tidal range in the order of 4 - 6 meters. Depths are measured in a zigzag pattern in the creek stretch between mouth and sluice. Suspended sediment concentrations are measured between 0.3 and 1 gram/L. Tidally and depth averaged concentrations in the order of 0.5 gram/L and 0.4 gram/L are observed at respectively 2 and 17 km from the mouth of the creek.<br/><br/>Part of this data is used to set up a Delft3D-flow model of the system that simulates the main sediment transport processes in the Nga Moe Yeik Creek. The initial hydrodynamic model is calibrated against observed water levels. In the next phase, the sediment transport model is used in a qualitative analysis to determine best suitable sediment parameters. Using a combination of model and collected data it is aimed to increase the insight in the siltation problem. <br/><br/>Both model and data showed similar hydrodynamic and sediment transport processes. The water level observations showed that the tidal wave deforms asymmetrically and becomes more flood-dominant as it propagates into the creek. A similar phenomenon is observed in the model results. Forced with a constant 2 gram/L the model generated tidally and depth averaged sediment concentrations in the same order of magnitude as the observations. From field observations and personal communication with local authorities, it is known that the siltation is most severe in the upstream end of the creek. This is also confirmed by the model results. In the scope of this work it is assumed that the model gives reliable results on the assessment of water levels and siltation.<br/><br/>The final model was used to assess several flushing scenarios (continuously or pulsatile flushing). Although all scenarios reduced thalweg siltation in the upper domain, pulsatile flushing reduced siltation slightly better. The scenario with 3 pulses gives best results followed by the scenario with 6 pulses. Less effective is the current flushing scheme with a continuous discharge. However to be able to give an quantitative answer on the extend of mitigation,more specific values of river discharge and critical bed shear stress are necessary.<br","Siltation; Tidal basin; Data poor environment; D3D-flow; Fieldwork; Yangon","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Hydraulic Engineering | Coastal Engineering","","16.963177, 96.245121"

Derailments result in loss of life, damage to rolling stock, service disruptions and harm the environment leading to the decrease in economic growth of a country. Improving train operating safety has been a high priority of the rail industry and the government. Train accidents occur as a result of many different causes; however, some are much more prevalent than others. One of the important causes for derailment is Rolling contact fatigue (RCF), which has gained more importance after the 1990’s due to the several derailment accidents caused by it. Rolling contact fatigue is a group of rail damages that manifest themselves on the surface or near surface regions of the rail. RCF arises due to the rolling/sliding contact stresses that occur between rail and wheel leading to severe plastic deformation of the rail head with RCF cracks resulting in high maintenance costs. Another consequence of plastic deformation is the formation of white etching layer (WEL), a martensitic layer created from the deformed pearlite while the rail is in service. Effect of WEL is to reduce the resistance of rail steel to crack initiation because of its brittle nature. <br/> In recent years, WEL has generated considerable research interests on its behavior under RCF conditions. Though most of the research carried out on WEL focuses either on the thermal or mechanical effects on its formation, little research has been carried out on the combined thermo-mechanical effects on WEL formation. In the present work, an attempt has been made to study the formation of WEL by thermo-mechanical simulation using the GLEEBLE thermo-mechanical simulator. Cylindrical samples prepared from the unaffected portion of the Dutch rail steel R260Mn were subjected to simultaneous deformation of maximum effective compressive strain of 3% and heating to maximum temperatures ranging from 650°C to 930°C. The simulation was carried out by varying the maximum temperature and no. of cycles. The metallurgical characterization of simulated WEL was performed using optical microscopy and scanning electron microscopy. The micro-hardness of WEL was studied using Vickers micro-hardness tester. The chemical composition of Mn was studied using electron probe microanalysis to ascertain the effect of Mn on band like formation occurred in samples processed at a certain temperature. <br/>It is observed that the simultaneous heating and deformation increases the amount of WEL formed when compared to simulation by only heating. Hardness is found to increase with increase in temperature. When the no. of cycles increases the amount of WEL formation also increases. Simulation at very high temperature results in homogenous formation of WEL with negligible amount of untransformed pearlite.<br","R260Mn; White Etching layer; Rail steel","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

I.e., the establishment of Ford Smart Mobility LLC has demonstrated its ambition to seek new mobility business models rather than a focus on manufacturing vehicles itself. Hereby, Ford has partnered with Lyft and Domino's to seize opportunities of self-driving cars with regard to ride-hailing and on-demand delivery services. Meanwhile, Ford evinced a burning interest of applying autonomous vehicles in logistics field in the 2018 Consumer Electronics Show. As a result, the design direction of logistics/delivery was decided. Future-oriented products such as autonomous cars, are ideal to plan and develop by a top-down approach. However, the approach is lacking of the voices from small and medium-sized companies, local organizations, and regional communities. Therefore, it is an opportunity for Ford to build up an autonomous mobility service by a bottom-up approach which empowers SMEs and local residents to customize the transits according to their needs. And so, the challenge of this project is ""sensing logistics opportunities from SMEs to form a service model as a local initiative by means of autonomous vehicles of Ford"". The double diamond design process was adopted to guide through this project. It started from a research phase to seize design insights, and then come up with design concepts based on the findings. In order to response to the challenge, the design methods of in-depth interview and future workshop were adopted to come up with design concepts via a bottom-up mindset. Ultimately, twelve interviewees had participated, they are business owners, delivery drivers, logistics stuffs, and logistics and transportation professors. The findings of the interviews were summarized as four case studies and twelve design directions. The cases cover from delivery types of business-to-business, business-to-consumer, and a small delivery company. In addition, the twelve design directions demonstrated the need and the want regarding to logistics in SMEs. Namely, information, companies, social value &amp; network, best planning, delivery, interaction, and supply chain. The design directions illustrated the current needs of SMEs, and the future workshop supplemented the expectations of autonomous vehicles from a perspective of community. Totally twenty-four expectations were generated from the future workshop. In the end, initial design concepts were come up with the integration of the twelve design directions and the twenty-four expectations. Collective Mobility Assistant, the final design concept, is a burden free autonomous mobility platform for SMEs/local residents. It offers four types of mobility: Delivery, Transit, Tour, and Event, which enables SMEs/local residents to transport goods or people according to their needs. Alternatively, the platform can be used as open space for people to contribute their personal skills for the communities. The autonomous mobility service offered by Ford invites more people to join the platform without worrying about the moving issue. The value of Collective Mobility Assistant matches the brand values of Ford ""people serving people"" and ""commitments to the community"".","service design; bottom-up; autonomous vehicles; SMEs","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","","","","","",""

The goal is to reduce the man hours required in the production and repair of the instrument. The client, Pigini Nederland, currently produces a small accordion for children and adults: the MiniMouse. This instrument is sold for 999 euros, which is a relatively low price for the amount of man hours invested. Pigini Nederland wants to lower the threshold of becoming familiar with the accordion by reducing the price of an entry-level instrument, similar to the MiniMouse in terms of functionality.<br/><br/>The sound of an accordion is produced by a reed: a piece of spring steel that vibrates when air flows past. To create a tone, the reed’s valve needs to be opened and an airflow needs to be created using the bellow. A mechanical structure of aluminium bars forms the connection between reed valve and button. A torsion spring keeps the valve in a closed position and creates resilience for the button.<br/>The production of an accordion is a complex process consisting of mostly manual operations. Some of these operations are rather time and labour intensive, such as shaping the body and inner mechanics, and creating the bellow. The repair of an instrument can be an inefficient process: the complete disassembly of certain components is sometimes necessary to replace a single component.<br/><br/>Producing parts with complex geometry is one of the strengths of AM. This can lead to a reduction in tooling and inventory and part consolidation. This is an important driver for choosing AM as a means of production.<br/>Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM) is chosen as the production technique for this project. FDM prints have good mechanical properties and require little post-processing. There is a wide range of materials available and the process and printer are relatively cheap. Pigini Nederland is interested in in-house production, which is realisable using an FDM printer.<br/><br/>The assignment focuses on the right hand side of an accordion, which has been fully designed and 3D printed. The fundament of the design is the instrument body. Multiple components are attached to it, resulting in a full-fledged instrument. For these attachments, non-printed connectors have been used as little as possible so that assembling the instrument is easy.<br/>The mechanical structure consists of separate arms that are placed in the body using snap fits. A printed spring-like element is incorporated so that the arms of the structure bend when a button is pressed to open the reed valve. As the material loses its natural resilience during the expected 10 year product lifetime, a steel compression spring is added to regulate the button pushing force.<br/>The buttons are attached to the mechanical structure using a snap fit. This makes it possible to quickly detach all buttons when repairing the instrument. In a conventional instrument, buttons are attached using glue and need to be broken off in such a scenario.<br/>The reeds of a conventional accordion are attached using molten wax. Since this is labour-intensive during production and repair, the reeds in the printed instrument are clamped onto the body using a rubber gasket, nuts and bolts. The size of the reed sound chambers is determined by analysing sound samples and comparing them pairwise in a user test.<br/><br/>The project outcome provides an indication on how to use AM for accordion production. A printed proof of concept showcases that the instrument is fully functional, while minor design recommendations need to be addressed. An estimation of the material cost and labour during production is made, and a cost reduction of roughly 15% of the full instrument is established. This is a large step forward, as only the right hand side of the product has been redesigned. It is a clear indication that additive manufacturing can be a valuable tool in lowering the engagement threshold for future accordionists.","additive manufacturing; accordion; 3D printing; fused deposition modeling; instrument; sound; Pigini; Music; product-focused; FDM; wind instrument; reeds","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","","","","","",""

A case study was performed on a dike section at Herrewijnen-Opijnen, which is part of the Heesseltse Uiterwaarden in the Dutch province of Gelderland. The dike located at this site no longer fulfils the required safety standards, and therefore dike reinforcement is required. This thesis focuses on reinforcing this dike with the new technique of dike pins. Dike pins are grouted steel anchors, that are installed in the dike crest to improve macro-stability. The case study shows that the governing geometrical parameter in design is the centre-to-centre distance of<br/>the dike pins. The cohesion of the clay slope was the governing geotechnical parameter for the determination of the slope safety factor. Arching occurred for high values of the friction angle or the cohesion of the sand layer. A large decrease in the bending moment of the dike pin results from arching. In this parametric study, correspondence was found between the 2D and 3D Plaxis models in terms of slope safety factor and in terms of the development of internal moments in the dike pin. A design scheme was suggested, which shows that in most cases a 2D design method may be chosen.

Handcrafted traffic light controllers (TLCs) are currently used to minimize the impact, but they are expensive to design and maintain and their performance degrades over time. Predictive TLCs and advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) form a potential solution but are still unfeasible in practice today because of their computational complexity and unpredictability.<br/><br/>The distributed predictive TLC developed in this thesis, called DIRECTOR, is feasible and enables time to green/red and green light optimal speed advice (GLOSA) systems. DIRECTOR utilizes predictions of the arriving traffic flows and a model of the current queue length to optimize the traffic light schedule. It can operate in two modes; Ad-hoc mode, where the schedule is generated and applied right away, and fixed-ahead mode, where the schedule is fixed in advance to enable ADAS. DIRECTOR's design makes it scalable and suitable for live learning, eliminating the need for expensive (re)calibrations and improving its performance with more and better data, which will become available in the near future.<br/><br/>A long short-term memory recurrent neural network is developed to predict the arriving traffic flows. On a case study this network proves to be on average 4.7% more accurate than the current state-of-the-art model, which is significant for a controller's performance.<br/>Simulations of the same case study intersection, which is currently equipped with a state-of-the-art actuated controller with green wave coordination, show that in ad-hoc mode DIRECTOR performs similar to the current controller. DIRECTOR reduces the average delay per vehicle by 1% (from 10.4s to 10.3s) at the cost of an increase of 15% in the average number of stops per vehicle (from 0.40 to 0.46) compared to the current controller. Simulations with ideal predictions show that, in ad-hoc mode, DIRECTOR has the potential to improve the average delay by 8.7% (from 10.4s to 9.5s) while keeping the number of stops equal (at 0.40).<br/><br/>Simulations with GLOSA show a 30% reduction in the average number of<br/>stops at the cost of a 13% increase of the travel time compared to the ad-hoc mode.

Both thermal conduction and advection can influence the performance of BTES systems, but thermal advection is often neglected in the design process. However, in areas with groundwater flow, the heat exchange between the BTES system and the soil can be significantly affected, as the stored heat is transported from the borehole with the flow. This project studies the influence of groundwater flow on the performance of a BTES system. A detailed 3D numerical model is created using MODFLOW and MT3D to simulate groundwater flow and heat transfer under various conditions. The model is verified using an analytical solution as well as experimental data, and is subsequently used to perform a sensitivity analysis and simulate a case study, in order to gain insight on the influence of groundwater flow on the heat exchange process and the conditions that favor this effect. The results reveal that groundwater flow is enhancing the heat exchange rates both in heating and in cooling mode. The magnitude of the effect depends on the total groundwater discharge, and the porosity and background temperature of the soil. In cases of combined heating and cooling, the effect also depends on the magnitude and ratio of the injected and extracted energy loads, as well as the frequency of switching between storage and extraction. Finally, it is revealed that groundwater flow is beneficial for systems with unbalanced energy loads, as it counterbalances the net heat extraction or injection that could decrease the system’s heat exchange capacity in the long term.","groundwater; BTES; geothermal energy; groundwater modelling; MODFLOW; MT3DMS; heat exchangers; Borehole Heat Exchanger (BHE)","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

For this reason it is of importance to create a multiscale understanding of the drivers behind deformation, and how deformation is accommodated. Carbonates have always been of interest to the oil and gas industry as carbonates house some of the world’s largest oil and gas reserves. Understanding, and maybe predicting the geometries and fracture types could therefore be of integral importance to the E&amp;P industry. For that reason two seismic datasets were provided for analysis on both a Fault Network Scale (faults over &gt;1km in length) and a Small Seismic Scale (faults &lt;1km in length). For the Fault Network Scale Petrel was used for seismic interpretation of the faults, as only the largest faults were interpreted in both seismic datasets. For the Small Seismic Scale OpendTect was used for enhanced seismic interpretation. OpendTect’s fracture enhancing attributes and filters provide seismic images with a high level of detail. These attributes were applied to 5 generated steering-cubes, to display even the smallest faults. The results on the Fault Network Scale show that most faults are caused by regional tectonics. However in areas where salt is underlying the chalks of the Chalk Group, halokinesis is the main driver of deformation. On the Small Seismic Scale drivers behind deformation differ more, fluid expulsion drives polygonal faulting patterns in areas where salt tectonics or far field extensional tectonics are absent. Towards halokinesis structures salt tectonics will be the main driver behind deformation. In areas where salt is absent, far field tectonics can still influence chalks forming fractures either parallel or perpendicular to the major surrounding faults.","Chalk; Fault; Fracture; Pattern; Polygonal; Attributes; OpendTect; Dip-Steering; Seismic; Characteristics; Driving; Mechanism","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The current version of the ZeBRo project, the DeciZebro, is made for the research to swarming in robotics, and is about the size of an A4-paper. <br/>To counter these shortcomings of CPG (a method to determine gait movement), Max-Plus algebra can be used for the timing of the legs of walking robots. This can be done by modeling a walking cycle as two discrete events. These events are the times of the lift-off and touchdown and can be determined by using a Max-Plus Discrete Event System (DES) framework. The main purpose of these events is to determine two separate periods; the stance period, and the swing or flight period. <br/>Max-Plus algebra is defined as a semi-ring over the union of real numbers and minus infinity. The standard binary operations are taking the maximum and addition which can be used for scalar and matrix operations. <br/>The Max-Plus linear system contain the gait matrix A, and the vector v(k) containing the lift-off and touchdown times of vector instance k. One of the strengths of this method is the ability to change gaits, by simply changing the A-matrix. This then results in the switching Max-Plus linear (SMPL) system: <br/>This SPML system determined in only contains gaits with successive recirculating leg-groups, where the synchronization of the lift-off of a certain leg-group I relies on the touchdown of the leg-group i-1. This allows for gaits like walking for humans, or a slow trot for horses, where a leg-group remains on the ground until the previous leg-group has recirculated. <br/>To increase the number of possible gaits, the synchronization of successive leg-groups is extended to not only contain the previous leg-groups' touchdown times, but also their lift-off times. This extension allows for gaits containing multiple rotation leg-groups at the same time, making gaits like the gallop possible. Because of the desired stable situation of grounded legs, the synchronization is chosen to not extend the timing of the touchdown, as delays should not hinder the return of the legs to their grounded position. <br/>The performance of different gaits is tested on different surfaces, to determine the influence of the amount of legs on the ground and determining whether gait changes could influence the success rate of the system regarding traversing rough terrain. Inertia measurement units (IMU) are used for detecting rough terrain, and tests show that the body movement of a ZeBRo on both flat and rough terrain are heavily influenced by the gaits used. <br/>Because of several limitations regarding the actuation of the legs, gaits containing moments of static instability could not be tested. However, the framework for implementation regarding the Max-Plus is lain and tested using simulations. <br","legged locomotion; max-plus algebra; discrete event system; gait; gait switching; Zebro","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The wind energy sector is one of the fastest growing commercial markets for epoxy resins, meaning that the structural behaviour of epoxy resins is becoming a key area of research, especially regarding its application to wind turbines. Wind turbines, particularly those in off-shore installations, are subject to a wide range of environmental conditions, most notably large variations in humidity and temperature. Both moisture and increased temperatures have been observed to have a significant impact on the stiffness and strength of epoxy resins. These environment effects, coupled with complex time dependent mechanical behaviour, means that the accurate prediction of the structural performance of epoxy resins has not yet been fully described.<br/><br/>This thesis presents a multiphysics framework for the simulation of hygrothermal ageing in epoxy resins. The constitutive model formulated in this thesis consists of a non-linear viscoelastic and viscoplastic mechanical model, physically coupled with a Fourier heat conduction model and a Fickian diffusion model. Degradation based on a glass transition surface is implemented to describe the multi-state behaviour of epoxy resins. To justify the model assumptions, DMA and creep tests are performed on epoxy resin specimens and their temperature dependent mechanical behaviour is established. A number of numerical benchmark tests and case studies are performed using a finite element implementation of the numerical framework. It is shown that the multiphysics framework can capture the characteristic mechanical and hygrothermal ageing behaviour exhibited by epoxy resins. Recommendations are provided for further development of the numerical model and calibration of the material properties. In a secondary study, a mesh sensitivity analysis is performed on an existing viscoelasitc-viscoplastic-damage model and recommendations for an improved formulation are provided.","Multiphysics; Viscoelasticity; Viscoplasticity; Epoxy Resin; FEM; Hygrothermal Ageing; Continuum Damage; Glass Transition","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Structural Engineering","",""

This report provides flood safety and coastal zone management solutions for the village of Holwerd, in the province of Friesland, Netherlands. High morphological dynamics and biodiversity characterizes this environment. Within this context, the Holwerd municipality, Wetterskip and Rijkswaterstaat were identified as key players to this study from a stakeholder perspective.<br/><br/>Alternative preliminary designs were presented to increase the resilience of the local sea dike and to recommend solutions for improving the ferry connection between Holwerd and the island of Ameland due to current dredging operations considered as excessive and which caused ferry delays. Careful consideration was given to designs due to the Wadden Sea being a UNESCO World Heritage Site and therefore protected under environmental legislation. Therefore, minimal negative environmental and ecological impacts were strived for in design of both the alternative dike designs and ferry connection alternatives. The impact that these alternatives may have on the socio-economy of Holwerd was also assessed where applicable.<br/><br/>Some alternatives were initially eliminated due to fatal flaws and the remaining options were evaluated by means of a multi-criteria analysis. The main criteria considered were the environmental impact, practical implementation, socio-economic impact, safety risk and reliability. Costs were evaluated through a subsequent cost-value assessment. The Wide Green Dike concept was the selected preferred solution as a reinforcement design to withstand extreme wave heights and water levels with a 1000-year return period, including sea level rise projections for the next century. This was achieved by performing an extreme water level analysis and wave transformation using the software Delft3D Wave. The Wide Green Dike concept would therefore ensure that the Holwerd sea dike still sufficiently meets the Dutch flood safety standards in the future. In relation to the navigability of the ferry, channel bend cuts are considered the feasible short-term solution to reduce the sailing time by 10 minutes. The long-term solution, adjusting vessel fleet sizes, potentially decreases the current maintenance dredging volume by 20%. The beneficial use of the dredged material for dike reinforcement and salt marsh development are suggested as integrated Building with Nature solutions to provide additional ecosystem services. Environmental Impact Assessments were conducted to identify potential risks related to each of the preferred alternatives and provide mitigation measures to ensure appropriate project implementation.","flood risk; ferry navigation; climate change; Coastal Engineering; dredging; dike assessment; coastal defense; Environmental Impact Assessment; Building with Nature; Multi Criteria Analysis","en","student report","","","","","","","","","","","","Coastal and Marine Engineering and Management (CoMEM)","","53.380195, 5.891690"

In The Netherlands the total heat demand needs to be reduced and the heat provision needs to become more sustainable (Kamp, 2015). By 2021, municipalities therefore need to have formulate plans on how they will realize the phase-out of natural gas in all districts in which the phase-out will take-place before 2030. In South Holland, district heating is considered a cost-effective alternative for the current gas based system. However, the Netherlands Environmental Assessment Agency (PBL) and the Province of South Holland (PZH) think differently about how district heating should be implemented and it is currently unclear what these differences exactly are and how they influence municipal policy for the phase-out of natural gas. In this thesis, we have therefore researched what the relevant differences between the two regional transition approaches are with regard to the implementation of district heating at a municipal level for realizing cost-efficient CO2 abatement. <br/>In consultation with the PBL and the PZH, we have developed four scenarios for the development of district heating. To analyse these scenarios, we have adapted an existing model of CE Delft, which can calculate the investment costs and fixed costs of district heating infrastructure. Furthermore, we have developed a dispatch model that can calculate the performance of a district heating system in terms of CO2 abatement and marginal costs of heat production. <br/>Based on this comparison of the approaches, a trade-off appears between cost-effective CO2 abatement, and maximizing the overall reduction of CO2 emissions. In which the scenarios of the PZH in general result in higher levels of CO2 abatement and the scenario of the PBL is more cost-effective. Additionally, in the light of the full phase-out of natural gas the approach of the PZH appears to suffer from higher initial investment risks but also provides better opportunities to realize large-scale district heating. However, the research has also pointed out that there are many uncertainties regarding the development of demand and supply that can average out the relatively small differences between the scenarios. <br/>One of these uncertainties is the willingness and ability of residents to participate in district heating. The decision-mandate lies with the consumer; however, current forecasts and policy processes are not sensitive to this mandate. Therefore, we have researched if Q-methodology can support municipalities in developing communication-and-decision making processes that fit with the need of heat consumers in this transition. The case study and focus group have indicated that Q-methodology can provide relevant and unique insights. However, to truly test the method it is necessary to run a larger case study in which the resulting perspectives are used to design a policy process and where this process is re-evaluated by the participants of the study. <br/><br","Transition governance; District heating; Q-methodology; Collective learning","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Applied Sciences | Science Communication","",""

The shocking outcome of the 1953 flooding proves this point. In modern days, the development of socioeconomic and climate change factors casts doubt on the effectiveness of conventional approaches to flood risk management. Consequently, this project explored new approaches to flood risk management. <br/>An analysis of climate change effects led to estimation of future loading conditions. Subsequently, a detailed hydrodynamic analysis was conducted. It highlighted the significant levels of uncertainty that climate change introduces into loading conditions. Also, it confirmed the team’s perception, that the Westkapelle case region requires additional safety measures to guarantee an acceptable level of safety in the future. But how to guarantee the acceptable level of safety in the most efficient way? The team adopted the concept of robustness to find an answer. In a keynote publication Mens (2015) describes robustness in the following way: ""Robust flood risk systems have some degree of resistance and some degree of resilience: the system can withstand some floods (no response), and for other (larger) floods impacts are limited and the system can recover quickly from the flood impact (response and recovery)."" The team set out to include robustness as an integral part of the design process to handle uncertainties. The project shall be seen as an explorative study how this can be done, revolving around Westkapelle as a case study that proves the methodology’s feasibility. Robustness and uncertainty were included on multiple levels throughout the design process. Firstly, the range of uncertainties was quantified. Secondly, the effect, that single parameters have on the magnitude of uncertainties, was assessed. Thirdly, the system’s capacity was analysed to find the required overtopping reduction for guaranteeing sufficient safety. Fourthly, constructive measures were assessed on their robustness potential and satisfaction of stakeholder needs via a Multi Criteria Analysis (MCA). The MCA was then employed to select the type of constructive and non constructive measures to achieve the required levels of overtopping and safety. With the information on uncertainties, the measures were combined to form a robust design, consisting of living breakwater, dike heightening, surface protection and two policy measures. Probabilistic analysis was also done to see the sensitivity of the failure probability to sea level rise in different loading and design scenarios. A thorough comparison between the conventional design, that has been applied to the project location, and the robust design followed. The robust design came out on top. Robustness was found to be an effective tool in countering uncertainties. Where conventional design methodologies are lacking flexibility and precision, the robust design methodology makes use of the system and its resilience to find an optimal solution. Its applicability may not be limited to flood risk management only but stretch out to other civil engineering disciplines.","Robust flood defence; Flood Risk; Climate Change; Design method; Hydrodynamics; Probabilisitic analysis; Multi Criteria Decision-Making; Overtopping; Uncertainities","en","student report","","","","","","All authors are equally contributing and credited authors.","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Hydraulic Engineering | Hydraulic Structures and Flood Risk","","51.5293, 3.4406"

To reduce loss-of-control-related accidents, it is important to estimate the safe flight envelope at the current flight condition and integrate it into flight control system design. This task is known as envelope estimation and protection. This project investigates this task on the Innovative Control Effectors aircraft, an over-actuated tailless fighter aircraft with complex aerodynamic coupling between control effectors. It has been observed that this aircraft can easily steer outside the flight envelope and lose control due to its huge control authority.<br/><br/>This thesis proposes a novel and practical framework for safe flight envelope estimation and protection, in order to reduce loss-of-control-related accidents. Despite that multiple envelope estimation methods exist in literature, conventional analytical estimation methods fail to function efficiently for systems with high dimensionality and complex dynamics, which is often the case for high-fidelity aircraft models. In this way, this paper develops a probabilistic envelope estimation method based on Monte Carlo simulation. This method generates a probabilistic estimation of the flight envelope with kernel density estimation by simulating a sample of flight trajectories with extreme control effectiveness, which describes the envelope more practically with fuzzy sets instead of conventional crisp sets. It is shown that this method can significantly reduce the computational load compared with previous optimization-based methods and guarantee feasible and conservative envelope estimation of no less than seven dimensions. This method was applied to the Innovative Control Effectors aircraft developed by Lockheed Martin. The estimation results are demonstrated by comparing different flight conditions and covariance analysis.<br/><br/>The estimated probabilistic flight envelope is used for online envelope protection by a database approach, which estimates the flight envelope offline and carries the results onboard for protection. Both a conventional state-constraint-based and a novel predictive probabilistic flight envelope protection systems were implemented on a multi-loop nonlinear dynamic inversion controller by extending the concept of pseudo control hedging. No systematic framework was available to apply envelope protection to such controller. Real-time simulation results prove that the proposed framework can protect the aircraft within the estimated envelope and save the aircraft from maneuvers that otherwise would result in loss of control. Possibilities were also explored to employ parametric models in envelope protection to simplify the database.<br/><br/>This work, however, is still limited to offline estimation with open-loop commands. Future work can extend this framework to aircraft damage models and closed-loop commands.","Flight envelope; Innovative Control Effectors; Flight Control Systems; Nonlinear control; Monte Carlo simulation; Reachability Analysis","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2021-07-10","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

(mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2018","Fibre metal laminates (FML) are manufactured by stacking metal sheets and fibre reinforced prepreg in an alternating fashion, and curing it in an autoclave. The most well-known FML is Glare, which has been successfully applied on Airbus A380 for its fuselage skin. It consists of aluminium sheets and glass fibre prepregs. FMLs have a better impact and fatigue performance compared to the bare metal and are therefore more damage tolerant. The drawback of Glare is the high manufacturing cost because of the use of an autoclave and the expensive prepregs. This study investigates the feasibility of vacuum infusion for the manufacturing of FMLs to reduce costs, while keeping an acceptable fibre volume content of 45% to 60%. An experimental approach is taken to explore the manufacturing process to determine under which conditions an infusion is possible, and to analyse which process parameters influence the duration of the infusion. Three variables: resin viscosity, vacuum infusion pressure and the reinforcement permeability are identified from Darcy’s law, which can influence the infusion process. The experimental data was gathered through multiple infusion process tests by adjusting these variables. Because the resin flow on the composite layers cannot be monitored visually through the metal sheets, glass plates are used to investigate these variables’ effect on the process. Through the analysis of the experimental data, the vacuum infusion process including the material selection, equipment and processing details are determined. Aluminium and dry glass fibre sheets are used to conduct the Vacuum Infusion process. The product is used to verify how the process parameters adhere to actual FML product fabrication. It can be concluded that during the experimental study, the Vacuum Infusion process has successfully been applied on the manufacturing of Fibre Metal Laminates with a satisfying fibre volume content of 54% to 65%, and a void content of 0.5% to 1.5%. By extrapolating the experimental infusion length curves, it was estimated that under the current conditions a maximum infusion length of 1.4 m most likely is possible when infused over the 0º direction, and a maximum infusion length of 1.0 m is expected to be possible when infused over the $90\degree$ direction. The total manufacturing cost of Vacuum Infusion process was found to be reduced 43% compared to the autoclave manufacturing process.

In this Ring-of-Fire project a Low-Speed PIV system is implemented in an indoor facility and used to test an amateur cyclist in both pedalling and non-pedalling conditions. Twenty cyclist’s passages can be executed in thirty minutes and provide a mean drag area with an uncertainty equal to 2%. Drag differences equal to 6% are measured between two postures. Limitations arise due to the lack of repeatability of seeding density and cyclist’s position. With the contribution of this research, the Ring of Fire becomes a more mature technique to investigate speed sports aerodynamics, with future applications to curvilinear trajectories and multiple athletes.<br","large-scale PIV; Ring of Fire; Cycling aerodynamics; HFSB","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2018-06-30","","","","Aerospace Engineering | Aerodynamics and Wind Energy","Supported by Netherlands Organisation for Scientific Research (NWO), Domain Applied and Engineering Sciences (TTW), project 15583: ""Enabling on-site sport aerodynamics with the ring of fire""",""

As a result, they can experience difficulty with everyday tasks such as making a grocery list or taking public transport. Low-literacy negatively impacts both the individual as well as society. Despite efforts to address low-literacy, the percentage of low-literates is rising. It is not just the older generation, five percent of 16-24-year-olds are low-literate, and children of low-literate parents are three times more likely to become low-literate themselves than other children are. Two-thirds of low-literates in the Netherlands are natives, but in practice, they are the group reached less by literacy efforts. They are often ashamed and successful at hiding it because they are fluent speakers. Those in programmes are often already in mature adulthood, whereas for both the individual and society it would be beneficial if education is sought earlier in life. Therefore, this thesis tries to design an intervention reach and activate a younger group to want to address their literacy issues. The main research question is: “What are the barriers and enablers to reach and activate native Dutch low- literates, in particular, young parents?”Because low-literacy is a social problem, both the individual and societal perspective is explored: the individual perspective through interviews with the target group, the societal perspective through desk-research, and both through conversations with employees at Stichting Lezen &amp; Schrijven who have much experience with the topic. These explorations resulted in ten design factors that serve as a basis for the intervention, as well as the insight that the low-literate’s dependency on those around him as well as the government, might be the core of the problem. As a result of this dependency, people’s self-efficacy can be diminished. A third perspective, a theoretical one, focussed on self-efficacy and related constructs, is taken. This perspective resulted in 18 extra design factors. At the same time of the theoretical exploration, the design of the intervention was started, in this way both influenced each other in the focus they had. The 19 theoretical factors go beyond the context of low-literacy and could, therefore, be applied to design projects that wish to increase self-efficacy. Resulting from insights based on context and theory, a design intervention is created that focusses on supporting young low-literate parents to engage with their children in the context of literacy through crafting. The design intervention is proposed to be offered as a promotional 11-week programme at a supermarket, available to all parents of young children, as a way to not single out those that are low-literate. The crafting instruction contains very little text, nevertheless the difficulty will slowly rise each week, the goal is to make the parent feel capable (self-efficacious) but at the same time show them they could benefit from improving their skills. The design is evaluated with professionals and users, showing that it is overall well-liked but the link to education could be improved. Due to time limitations, it was not possible to assess whether the intervention manages to increase self-efficacy, a pilot is proposed as a way to verify the effectiveness of the design. As a result of these evaluations, a final design is created that incorporates reading of the instruction even more fully.","Social design intervention; low-literacy; Self-efficacy; SID-method; Dutch low-literates","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","","","","Design for Interaction | Science Communication","",""

Markets are never stable, customers’ needs and wishes change and technology evolves. This leaves companies with the option to either adapt to the ever-changing conditions they are exposed to or to be changed in the face of competitive pressure. <br/><br/>However, innovation should happen in the right direction. The idea of innovating just for the sake of growth is outdated and obsolete. The world is out of balance and our current economy is failing us, which means that it is of high importance that we move towards a balance in which we meet the needs of all within the means of our planet. <br/><br/>Outside Inc. tries to contribute to this highly ambitious goal by creating innovation acceleration programs together with existing organisations that will help them find new products and services. These programs combine the entrepreneurial qualities of people with a more sustainable and social mind-set.<br/><br/>In order to make a real impact, Outside Inc. currently needs to grow. Not necessarily grow to become the biggest or the most profitable, but grow to become more resilient. They believe that this growth should be accomplished by creating more recurring long-term relationships instead of the single short-term relationship that are currently mostly formed with their clients.<br/><br/>An extensive research was conducted in order to generate insights into why client relationships are mostly single short-term. A company analysis, a case study of 8 cases and a client analysis based on 6 interviews and 2 observations uncovered, among other insights, three underlying reasons: a miss-alignment in the expectations, a diminishing of the perceived added value and a doubt about the effectiveness of the program.<br/><br/>In order to provide the first step towards solving these problems, a toolset is developed. This toolset consists of a workshop format, an A1 canvas and a set of cards that function as a conversation facilitation tool. The toolset is to be used in a kick-off session at the beginning of a project by the core-team. This core-team exists of two program managers and one to three representatives of the client.<br/><br/>By using this toolset together with the core-team, Outside Inc. program managers are able to manage the expectations, provide proper demarcation, build an understanding of the client, make the client co-owner of the process and provide a foundation for a possible new fit in the future. <br/><br/>Furthermore, Outside Inc. is advised to continue with the improvement of their own identity and value proposition. By doing so, Outside Inc. can make the fit between the client and the value proposition easier and more adaptable to the evolution of the client. <br/>It is also advised that Outside Inc. continues to do more client research then before. Not only by means of traditional customer research (e.g. evaluation forms/surveys etc.) but also by personally interviewing clients after approximately 1 year after finishing the program. By doing so, Outside Inc. gains valuable information but also builds a new connection with the client that could result in future programs, which could in turn, result in a recurring long-term relationship.","Long-term relationship; client relationship; Conversation facilitation; Tool; Toolset; Canvas; Cardset","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","","","","Strategic Product Design","",""

Governments gather and distribute open data as they see sharing data as a responsibility of a transparent government. However, the representation of this data is typically hard to understand and difficult to use. The main problem that open data systems pose to municipalities is that citizens do not see and use the open data that is gathered and provided. This project aims to tackle this problem by making citizens aware of aspects of their environment that are invisible to them and does so by communicating open data using connected bikes. <br/>Public bikes are viewed as a design opportunity for use as data providers to citizens for several reasons. They are located throughout the city, so will be viewed in the entire city. Because of their movement, the bikes serve as an interesting communicator of location-based data. The bike can show data about the environment of the location in which it is currently situated. Public bikes have become more visible in the Dutch urban landscape and are increasingly present in, especially, Amsterdam and Rotterdam. This project is based in the city Rotterdam, more specifically the district Delfshaven. <br/>The design space for this subject was explored through three sections: data, bike interface and social perception. Each of the three sections was explored individually. The sections were explored through literature research, benchmarking on other projects, quick prototyping and small user tests. Based on this research, several parameters were presented for consideration in a final design. <br/>Through design explorations, interdependencies between the presented parameters were determined. A creative session with design students was held where the use of the design space and the interdependencies between the sections as a design tool was tested. Based on the feedback of the creative session, a design tool for designing city-wide open data displays with connected bikes was created. The design tool was evaluated by the creation of three design examples. <br/>Together, the design space and tool form a design framework that will provide guidance to designers that will tackle this subject in the future. The created design examples give an impression of the possibilities when designing for this subject. <br/>From here, the design framework should be completed further by mapping and describing financial and technical feasibility. Furthermore, the design tool should be further evaluated by other designers. Lastly, as this project was conceived of as an exploratory one, the goal was not the thorough testing and subsequent realisation of one concept. Therefore, the actual effects that such a design could have in a neighbourhood are still unknown and should be explored further.","Design; Smart City; Connected Bikes","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","","","","Design for Interaction","",""

The Dutch festival Lowlands, a three-day event, for example uses 300.000 kwh of electricity generated by diesel-fuelled generators, 10.000 m3 water and 500.000 kg of solid waste (Amsterdam Institute for Advanced Metropolitan Solutions, 2017). As a result, the attention is growing to find ways how to organize more sustainable events. Initiatives like Green Events support this development, by seeing the festivals as an ideal testing ground for new sustainable innovations.<br/>One festival taking the green developments at heart to become a more sustainable event is DGTL revolution.Throughout the year DGTL Revolution is searching for new technologies and innovations, they can introduce at the festival to reduce their waste, lower their emissions but moreover create awareness and stimulate sustainable action amongst their visitors (DGTL Revolution, 2017). A project Revolution has focused on this year, is their plastic material stream.<br/>Despite of the hard cup and deposit system which is in place at the festival, the festival still has a large amount of single use plastic water bottles. The need for a change in our current wasteful plastic economy has been a subject which is being discussed more and more. The single use plastic bottles form an opportunity for DGTL festival to discover circular ways of processing PET bottles, minimizing their plastic footprint and taking the visitors along in this vision.<br/>This graduation project has started with an extensive research to the current sustainable efforts of festivals, the view of visitors on those efforts and the current challenges in plastic recycling outside the festival context. This is done through desktop research and several interviews with festival visitors and experts. A key finding of the research were the several barriers visitors experience, stopping them from behaving pro-environmental, like collecting and separating plastic at a festival or in their home environment. DGTL should facilitate a deposit system which overcomes those barriers of individuality, responsibility and practicality.<br/>The following design brief was formulated from all the insights of the research; ‘How can DGTL positively change visitors attitude towards plastic recycling, using the deposit system at DGTL as a vehicle, illustrating its aim and result increasing people’s feel of responsibility.’<br/>During the exploration phase new innovations in plastic recycling have been approached to collaborate with DGTL festival, aiming to process the plastic bottles into valuable resources again. Next to those innovations, the focus was on getting the visitors more involved in the goal of the deposit system. Overcoming the barriers by increasing the practicality of the system and showing them the aim and result of the system. This could have an effect on their perspective towards plastic recycling, and stimulate them to copy this behavior outside of the festival context.<br/>The final concept which was implemented at the festival consisted of several elements. The central point was called the resource street. Here all the materials of the festival came together at the recycle hub were they were checked and separated (Figure 2). Furthermore the visitors were able to see the chemical recycling innovation pyrolysis, turning bottle caps into oil, a plastic container where all the plastic bottles were collected, showing it massive amount to the visitor as well as explaining how the bottles will be recycled into high quality rPET.<br/>This concept is further supported by several decentralised designs namely transparent collection behind the bars, signing with information about the system and last mobile collection vehicles. All those elements have been implemented at the festival and evaluated, through interviews, a questionnaire and some data analysis about the collection.<br/>This master thesis describes the first steps a festival can take, to move towards a more transparent resource handling, through which valuable resources can be regained from plastic bottles. At the same time, the visitor is involved in this system, leading to a larger effect by improving their perspective and behavior towards plastic recycling.","festival; circular economy; plastic; zero-waste","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","","","","","",""

Shipping companies are becoming more and more data driven due to developments in data systems and these harsh market conditions. The goal of this research is to determine how and how much added value can be realised through shipping performance management with the help of a ship performance monitoring system within Spliethoff Group. This research continues after the development of the performance monitoring system. The demand or this research arrived from the fact that simply putting a performance monitoring system in place does not realise added value. Applying the knowledge creation from the performance monitoring system through well structured performance management is what realises the added value. Determining the methods and quantifying the potential results is what is done to realise the goal of this research.<br/>During the research it is found that high data quality is of the utmost importance in order to accurately asses the performance of a vessel. A structured method for assessing the data collected by the performance monitoring is found and applied to the performance monitoring system as a verification. Data quality deficits such as the speed of the ETL processes, incorrect data blending and calculations are identified and corrected. This led to a near live, high quality data stream which can be used to asses and optimise the performance. Continual assessment and improvement of the data quality is recommended.<br/>Suitable methods to analyse this data to create knowledge are determined. A form of hybrid modelling where simple theoretical models are fitted to the filtered data using regression is used to create baselines and give a clear overview of the effects of certain operational parameters on the performance of a vessel. These models can then also be used to increase the accuracy of tools such as the weather routing and voyage planning tool. Benchmarking between sister vessels or the baselines is seen as a good means to identify performance deficits. Visualising and analysing the data with the help of a BI tools is a good way to share the knowledge throughout the company.<br/>The performance management in place at Spliethoff is assessed to form a baseline to improve upon. It became apparent that Spliethoff overall has a good idea how to optimise performance but it does not have the information or data needed to do so. Since there is no information about the gain in performance of certain tools they are not used correctly. Being able to show the performance gain from using these tools is an important benefit of the performance monitoring system. The communication and knowledge sharing throughout the company can also be improved with the use of the performance monitoring system. Poor follow up from upper management when performance deficits on top of this indicate that a lot of value can be created with an improved performance management plan which incorporates the performance monitoring system.<br/>A new performance management plan based on ISO 50001 is proposed to realise this value. Due to the available data the management plan focuses on reducing fuel costs and optimising voyage planning.This is done by awareness creation through performance dashboards which also increase the information sharing between shore and vessel. A change in company culture to a more data based decision making and communicative culture is promoted and implemented through this plan. <br/>To determine how much added value can be realised, the costs and value realisation potentials of the performance management system are specified. These are then used to determine the net present value of the performance management project for several scenarios. A large fleet and a small fleet implementation are researched. The total capital investment is either €543,000 when only the large consumers of the fleet are included (small fleet) or €1,310,000 when almost the entire fleet is included (large fleet). Only the direct monetary value is used to determine the net present value but indirect and non monetary values are also mentioned. The direct monetary value potentials are derived from operational cases where performance deficits have been identified. The resulting total added value (NPV) of the small fleet implementation ranges from €2,165,970 in a pessimistic scenario to €8,711,272 in an optimistic scenario after 11 years. €6,000,146 is the expected total added value realisation for the small fleet implementation after 11 years. For the large fleet the results are: €4,966,756 for the pessimistic scenario, €18,103,704 for the optimistic scenario and and expected added value of €12,805,994 after 12 years. Most scenarios have a pay back period of less than 2 years with the exception of the pessimistic scenario of the large fleet which has less than 3 years. All indirect and non monetary value is seen as a bonus on top of this meaning that there certainly is a lot of added value to be realised by implementing performance management which is supported by a performance monitoring system.","Shipping Management; Ship Performance Management; performance management; Performance Monitoring; Ship performance monitoring; Performance analysis; Performance Data Analysis; Energy Efficiency; Data analysis","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2023-06-06","","","","","",""

Annualised hours problems are a widely studied subjects, in which the working hours for a given number of employees per week are minimised. We approach this problem with a mixed integer linear program, where the objective function of this problem is divided into two parts; the first is to find the minimisation on the maximum over and under staffing per week, the second to find working hours for each employee as close as possible to their contract hours. Additionally, we have a number of restrictions on the duration of a shift and the minimum and maximum amount of shifts in a given period.<br/>The project is done in collaboration with the company ORTEC. ORTEC provided a random data generator, to test the model with different methods. The model is intended for application on a dataset of 100 employees and 52 weeks. However, we test the model on different data sets of 52 weeks with 50, 100, 150, 200, 250, 1000 employees and for 100 employees with 26, 52, 78 weeks.<br/>Besides analysing the model, we compare different algorithms. We use a Gurobi solver for an exact solution. Further, we consider Lagrangian relaxation, a heuristic method. In this method one of the constraints is put in the objective function. Besides this we consider a heuristic of hill climbing algorithm in combination with different local search algorithms. For the local search we use two neighbourhoods, one based on the employees, the other based on the weeks.<br/>We found that a Gurobi solver solves the model in reasonable computation time with an average of 6 seconds for a data set of 100 employees and 52 weeks. For Lagrangian relaxation, we found an even better computation time than with the Gurobi solver.

These catastrophic events may result in mass casualty incidents, which are defined as: “[…] An event that overwhelms the local healthcare system, with number of casualties that vastly exceeds the local resources and capabilities in a short period of time.” (Ben-Ishay et al., 2016). If too many casualties clog the local healthcare infrastructure, victims need to be prioritized for transportation and treatment, based on the severity of their injuries. Otherwise, the number of fatalities may unnecessarily increase. Triage processes have been developed to streamline the transport and treatment of casualties, and although varieties on assignment of priorities exist, all triage processes focus on high, medium and low priorities for victims. Both the Dutch civilian and military emergency services will conduct, in case of a large incident with an overwhelming amount of casualties a ‘Scoop &amp; Run’: The first ambulance to arrive at the scene will oversee and maintain control over the situation (Command &amp; Control). The following ambulances and responders will then start a quick triage, establishing who will need to be transported as quickly as possible. Based upon this first triage, the most severely injured (with heavy Airway, Breathing or Circulation injuries) will be immediately transported to medical treatment facilities. This process is not necessarily meant to save all casualties, but increases the survivability rate of the total amount of casualties. In the case of a domestic MCI, the Royal Netherlands Army may be involved along with civilian emergency services, creating a complex, hierarchical web of stakeholders. The challenge for both the impromptu established command structure as well as the first responders, is to untangle the chaotic context in order to create a clear oversight and to quickly allocate the appropriate resources. This project therefore focuses on enhancing seamless interactions between military (medical) professionals during an MCI, as it is vital for an efficient response to an MCI that confusing and erroneous information flows are curtailed, and oversight is established as quickly as possible.","Seamless Interactions; Triage; Military; Mass Casualty Incidents; Medical Professionals; Pre-hospital trauma care","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","","","","","",""

This lagoon is connected to the sea through a small culvert, which enables a limited amount of water exchange. Since a few years, fishermen have been unable to catch fish in this lagoon, because of invasive plants restraining them from entering the basin. The siltation rate is high due to increasing friction because of these plants and limited sediment outflow through the small culvert. Furthermore, the water quality in the lagoon is poor. An overland flow model and a mixing model are used to evaluate the effects of a change in layout of the lagoon mouth.

Current renewable energy production is mainly focused on solar and wind. However, for many industries their infrastructure is not adapted to electricity as an energy source. Therefore, a full transition to wind and solar is not viable on the short term. More than 50% of the current industry still relies on fossil fuels. This means there is a strong need for renewable fuels, like liquid hydrocarbons, which can directly be applied in the existing infrastructure. <br/><br/>ZEF: Reinventing the Chemical Industry <br/>Zero Emission Fuels (ZEF), a startup focusing on the production of renewable methanol (also a liquid hydrocarbon), aims for a different approach in chemical industry. Current commercial routes to renewable hydrocarbons have not been succesful so far in the global market. By using a scalable number of microplants, opposed to upscaling an industrial size plant, the advantage in terms of cost per kilogram, saving money and time could be significant, because no intensive research and testing regarding upscaling is required. Instead of upscaling the entire plant, simply the number of microplant could be increased to satisfy the renewable MeOH demand. Hence, a small player as ZEF, with fast and cheap growing potential, is able to enter the methanol market by offering renewable methanol at competitive prices of $350/ton in a mainly fossil fuel driven methanol market. ZEF’s product is a fully automated solar panel add-on which converts air to liquid methanol. The microplant extracts H2O and CO2 from the air and uses it to synthesize methanol. This means that CO2 emitted in the atmosphere can be recycled into a renewable fuel. Hence, ZEF poses a solution to close the CO2-cycle. An advantage of the microplant is that it is location independent because water and carbon dioxide are available everywhere. The system is a series of nine subsystems, all of which are based on existing technologies and powered by solar energy. The aim of ZEF is to reach an overall system efficiency of 55%. The numbering-up approach requires the microplant to be suitable for mass-production.<br/><br/>The challenge<br/>The backbone of the microplant is the subsystem which integrates the eight other subsystems. By integrating the different subsystems, the number of parts and thus cost can be reduced significantly. This is a requirement indispensable to the feasibility of the business idea. Thus, the central question in the perspective of the business case and this thesis is to verify whether a reserved budget of EUR 3,5 per backbone is realistic. Is there a backbone which can be designed to correspond to the technical and financial requirements? <br/><br/>Objective <br/>The combination of technical requirements and a tight cost target demands a smart design of the backbone. Therefore, the focus is on product architecture, material choice and mass-manufacturing at a minimal cost. The result is a feasibility study towards the mass-manufacturing aspect applied on the backbone of an energy system. This should all be carried out within the boundaries of the business plan. <br/> <br/>Approach<br/>In essence, the feasibility study in terms of a cost analysis is straight forward. A material, volume and production method need to be determined in order to validate the business plan. First, a material needs to be found which is as cheap as possible and complies with the technical requirements. The technical requirements involve coping with aggressive chemicals, elevated temperatures and high pressures. Once a suitable material is found, the volumes are to be looked into. The size of the several subsystems needs to be estimated. Subsequently, a compact layout positioning is needed to minimize the total backbone surface area. Ultimately, the volume is determined by applying a Finite Element Method (FEM) and topological optimization through simulations using Computer Aided Design (CAD) software on the chosen backbone concept. This concept is an approach to integrate all essential functionalities related to the aforementioned other eight subsystems. A prototype of the concept, called the backbone “sample”, has been manufactured by computer numerical controlled (CNC) milling. Finally, a feasibility study was carried out to investigate the possibility for mass manufacturing of the backbone. This feasibility study was based on a cost analysis and on the results of the backbone testing. <br/><br/>Results<br/>The result of this thesis is a product architectural layout applied on a three-plated backbone concept. The CNC-milled prototype (figure c) contains real size partial solutions for all main functionalities of the targeted backbone. These functionalities range from crossing canals subjected to different pressures towards the integration of valves, a buffer and actuators. Hence, the merit of the design is the possibility to copy-paste sub-solutions wherever needed in a future backbone design, even an injection moldable variant. Regarding the cost model, an approach is presented to quickly estimate the material price for a new backbone design. This approach is driven by a fixed amount of material required per functionality. This amount is based upon the material choice and the topology optimization. Regarding testing the CNC-milled backbone sample, the integration of functionalities has proven to be successful. However the custom made seals failed to be leak tight. <br/><br/>Conclusion<br/>The feasibility study of the mass-manufacturing aspect of the backbone based on a cost analysis and results gathered from testing the backbone sample. A cost analysis has been carried out, based on a material suited for mass-manufacturing, design for mass-manufacturing itself and an amount of material necessary. This cost analysis was compared to the target backbone cost defined by ZEF. Based on the developments regarding the entire microplant design of May 2018, the backbone weight is estimated at 7kg and it is made out of the material PET 45% glass fiber (GF). This material is found to be in line with the numerous technical and financial challenges. The weight of 7kg assumes the integration of a 1.3l hydrogen buffer for 1 hour, a 0.7l carbon dioxide-water buffer for two hours, 1.5m piping, 14 one-way partially servomotor controlled valves and three solenoid operated valves. A safety factor of two was applied to guarantee the backbone to be self-bearing and provide support to the subsystems. The final design is a three-plated backbone measuring 200x400mm. Considering a production volume of 500 000 injection mold backbones, one backbone is expected to cost EUR 9,22. Thus, the cost estimation is not in line with the targeted cost of EUR 3,5. Also, regarding testing the backbone sample, the custom made seals have proven not to work. Therefore, the design should be reviewed in terms of weight optimization and detail design. Despite the results, the costs are not far off. Possible opportunities to cut costs are mentioned in the recommendations. <br/><br/>Recommendations<br/>Based on new input of the overall microplant design, the parametric models of the material search and the volume estimation of subsystems, the cost analysis can be adjusted. Hence, these models are a valuable benchmark for further research. Regarding the detail design, it is recommended to work around seals in the next backbone design. These seals are a weak point in the current backbone design and are susceptible to failure. By avoiding seals, the risks with regard to performance and assembly are seriously reduced. Therefore, in a next design step injection molding experts could be approached to help think about a backbone design which is suitable for injection molding without seals. <br/>With respect to the design of the backbone, it is advised to keep cavities as small as possible. For every aspect, which is subjected to higher pressures, ranging from canals to buffers, it must be checked whether it can be reduced in volume. The smaller the pressurized surface area, the lower the stresses on the material, the less material is needed, the lower the backbone cost. Thus, it is recommended to prioritize design for weight optimization in the next backbone design. In relation to weight optimization, design for hybrid materials needs more attention. Other important considerations are mounting the backbone to the solar racking system, cavity creep as a result of a long term load case exposure, permeability of the material with respect to H2 and CO2 and the effect of mutual influences of temperature, chemicals and pressure on the material choice.<br/><br","Chemical Industry; Renewable Methanol; Design for Mass Manufacturing; Feasibility Study","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","","","","Integrated Product Design","Zero Emission Fuels",""

It has applications in many different scientific and engineering disciplines, for instance as a solution to the non-linear Schrödinger equation which describes how electro-magnetic waves travel through ideal non-linear media. Hence, the non-linear Fourier transform is fundamental for communication schemes that take optical fiber non-linearities into account. <br/>Wahls et al. proposed an algorithm for a fast inverse non-linear Fourier transform based around a discretization of the non-linear Schrödinger equation. But one of the steps in the algorithm — known as synthesis — only had heuristic solutions. However, the problem closely resembles a Nevanlinna-Pick interpolation with degree constraint, a problem known to have a guaranteed solution. Indeed, synthesis is a limit case of Nevanlinna-Pick interpolation with degree constraint on the boundary of the region of analyticity. Although there are solvers to the boundary Nevanlinna-Pick interpolation with degree constraint available in the literature, they do not scale to the numerical difficulty or size required, and are based around simplifying assumptions that do not hold for synthesis.<br/>In this thesis I propose two different numerical continuation solvers for synthesis. The methods have lower computational complexity than other guaranteed solvers by using fast linear Fourier transforms to perform polynomial operations. Moreover, the convergence speed of the algorithms is improved by approaching the solution in a novel trajectory. However, the solvers only offer a quicker convergence rate than the heuristic methods for very difficult problems, and may not be effective for real-time applications, as the high-demands in error precision required means a very high computational cost. This seems to be a limitation of the theory, as the high computational cost is a consequence of the large number of iterations required even when the cost of each iteration is low.","analytic interpolation; nonlinear Fourier transform; numerical continuation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Systems and Control","",""

The superstructure of the existing floating bridges is usually constructed from steel. In a marine environment these bridges are exposed to dynamic wave loads. As such, the current floating bridges suffer severe damage due to corrosion and fatigue. Using fiber reinforced polymer instead of steel could alleviate these phenomena and reduce maintenance costs. However, the lower stiffness could cause undesired vibrations in the floating bridge. Therefore a parametric model is developed to investigate the influence of design parameters on the dynamic response of a floating pontoon bridge.<br/><br/>A literature study is performed to find suitable concepts and techniques to develop the floating bridge model. A floating pontoon bridge can be schematized with rigid bodies, Euler-Bernoulli beam elements and linear springs and dashpots. The fluid-structure interaction is taken into account by including the added mass, hydrodynamic damping, hydrostatic stiffness and wave force transfer functions of the pontoons. A frequency domain approach is used to compute the dynamic response. <br/><br/>A parametric model of a floating pontoon bridge to predict the dynamic response is developed in Python. The hydrodynamic properties of the pontoons are computed by Diffrac and are used as input for the Python model. The Bergsøysund bridge is used as a reference case, because measurement data of this bridge’s dynamic response is available and can be used for validation.<br/>The geometrical and structural properties of the Bergsøsund bridge are used to model its dynamic response. Wave conditions with a peak frequency at 2 rad/s are used. The results show that the response of the pontoons is governing compared to the response of the superstructure and that the dominant degree of freedom is sway. The fourth sway mode is the main contributor to this dynamic response. A comparison with measurement data shows that the produced response spectra are in good agreement with the measurements in terms of the peak locations.<br/><br/>In the parametric study the influence of single design parameters on the dynamic response of a floating bridge is investigated independently. The results show that the length of the superstructure has the biggest influence on the dynamic response of the floating bridge. In general, a reduction in stiffness in the superstructure leads to a lower overall frequency response function and thus to a lower dynamic response. Increasing the stiffness or reducing the mass of the bridge shifts the eigenfrequency of the fourth sway mode to a higher frequency and vice versa. Finally, when the damping is increased, the peaks in the frequency response function decrease and thereby the dynamic response in resonance reduces.<br/><br/>In conclusion, the dynamic response of a floating end-supported pontoon bridge is mainly influenced by the stiffness of the superstructure. A fiber reinforced polymer superstructure should be designed sufficiently stiff, especially in lateral direction, to keep the overall frequency response function low enough. <br","Floating bridges; Structural Dynamics; Fluid Structure Interaction; Fiber reinforced polymer; Frequency domain","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","","62.987178, 7.879533"

The design challenge was approached with the concept of relevance as an initial framing. To this end, several stages of analysis were performed. First, a study was done of the definitions and inherent challenges of small museums, and the implications of these challenges towards designing solutions for teenagers. Several themes and insights were discovered in this phase, such as the use of museum communities, and to explore and harness the stories that belong the contents of a museum. The second analysis phase consisted of a theoretical study of the target in order to specify the specific age group and further characteristics, and a design workshop that was done with high school students, to gain insights into the sentiments of the target group towards museums. Among other things, it was discovered that such elements as adventure and identity are very effective in speaking to teenagers. From these two phases, a set of overarching themes was compiled, which acted as a inspiration and soft criteria for the idea synthesis.<br/>Eventually, three concepts were developed. The first, History Defense, is a mobile game that aims to make teenagers familiar with small museums and their value to society. It tells a compelling and immersive story that underlines the importance of local heritage in a classic battle between good and evil. The game is primarily played on a mobile device, from anywhere, but incorporate real-time (and real-world) events that encourage players to visit a museum and learn about its contents and stories. The game’s main goal is to make the players familiar with the cultural and historical value of local heritage institutions.<br/>The second concept is called Haunted Museums. This is a narrative framework that helps museums to attract young visitors by making the museum ‘haunted’. Museums create a personalized story based on their collection, and host thematic events to support the narrative. Through overarching themes that change annually, museums can tell exciting stories and create immersive experiences for visitors. The culmination of the yearly theme is an event week, where museums can decorate the museum to match the theme, invite performers, and create other immersive experiences for their visitors. Because the themes and promotion of the events are centrally coordinated, the platform becomes a quality label for immersive museum experiences.<br/>The third and final concept, Treasures, is a social platform that allows its users to explore artworks online and gather suggested artwork and museum pieces into personal collections. Based on the collections they have built and the interests those collections imply, users get continually improving personalized suggestions other artworks they might like, and add to their collections. Collections may take one of several forms, such as personal favorites, wishlists or checklists for seeing objects in real life, or collections that depict a specific theme or story.<br/>Finally, the three concepts were evaluated with both museums and teenagers, and the findings of these evaluations sessions were compiled as final recommendations for the further development of the concepts. After that, a personal theoretical analysis was done as a way to demonstrate how the concepts differ from each other, and give suggestions for which concept to choose for further development.<br","Museum Experience; Museum Futures Lab; Relevance","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","","","","Design for Interaction","Hidden Gems",""

This process is called rapid intensification and as a result, tropical cyclones can transform into hurricanes. Rapid intensification is related to the availability of heat and the amount of negative feedback of the ocean on the tropical cyclone. Negative feedback results in the weakening of the tropical cyclone. Cyclones passing over a warm ocean anomaly have access to more heat and due to the relatively high temperatures, the amount of negative feedback is reduced considerably. A necessary condition for rapid intensification is therefore the presence of a warm ocean anomaly, often being warm core eddies. This paper relates the rapid intensification of tropical cyclone Matthew to the presence of warm core eddies in the track of Matthew. Results show that there is no extensive evidence found for the presence of a warm core eddy before rapid intensification took place. Although maps of the sea surface height and sea surface temperature indicate the possible existence of a warm core eddy, surface velocities do not show the characteristic rotation flow of an eddy. The enthalpy flux is considerably large just before the rapid intensification of Matthew indicating that the negative feedback by the ocean is reduced and heat is available for transport. The rapid intensification of Matthew might be linked to other physical mechanisms that have been overlooked. Possible mechanisms identified are the Amazon-Orinoco river plume and La Ni˜na. Further studies on the rapid intensification of tropical cyclone Matthew should therefore take into account these mechanisms and study their influence on rapid intensification.","Tropical Cyclone; Warm Core Eddies; Caribbean Sea; Negative Feedback; Rapid Intensification; Air-Sea Fluxes; Air-Sea Interaction","en","student report","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

From aircraft fuselages to storage silos and boat hulls, these structures are employed for their structural efficiency and the aesthetics they provide. They are characterised by a small thickness in comparison to their other dimensions and by curvature in their unstressed state. Despite their structural efficiency transferring loads in their plane, thin concrete shells are not employed quite often. The traditional construction method is a labour intensive process which includes the fabrication of a formwork system, usually made out of plywood, on which concrete is cast. The necessary reinforcement in the form of bars although it is quickly placed, it has the drawback of requiring frequent joints and overlapping. Its bending and assembling is also considered difficult for curved shapes like shells. As it can be seen, great costs emerge from this process and this was a trigger factor for the formation of the research question. A different approach for the construction of shells employs prefabricated elements which are connected on site and create the complete thickness of the concrete shell. Although high construction speed and high quality are achieved with this method, significant reduction of costs is still not feasible, as the formwork is very expensive and re-use of it, is only occasionally possible. However, an adjustable mould can produce elements of different dimensions, shape and curvature, decreasing substantially the formwork costs which comprise large part of the total shell construction costs. The flexible mould method and the principle of deformation after casting that were introduced by Prof. R.H. Schipper find application in this project. This project aims to answer whether it is possible to construct a concrete shell using the flexible mould prefabricated elements, without putting aat risk the stability of the structure. A comparison between the structural feasibility of a monolithic shell and the one of a segmented prefabricated shell is the method that will be utilised to answer the research question.","Concrete shell structures; Flexible mould; Prefabrication; Free-form architecture","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Building Engineering","",""

This process can be sped up based on the coherence between images, and is the aim of the presented study.

Research question: What are the characteristics of marketing in project development, focussed on the corporate level, project level and the end-user and how are they related?Research design/method/approach: To gain insight on the relation between marketing and real estate development, a multiple case study is conducted. Three project development companies are studied by means of one representative case and one extreme case. Furthermore, the marketing managers are studied to provide insights in the role of marketing on the corporate level. By means of literature review, document analysis and cross case analysis, theoretical and empirical findings are conducted. These findings are compared and have led to the characteristics of marketing in project development. Findings: The graduation research has resulted in a set of characteristics, based on the corporate level, project level and the end-user. Results are; the position of marketing in the business organisation is becoming increasingly important and is indicated that marketing is not part of the competences of a project developer and many of the marketing tasks are based on experience and knowledge and involve external parties. Therefore, extern experts, such as publicity agencies and brokers, are involved in the development process. The marketing of a house is partly based on the promotion of an experience, in which the brand and the look &amp; feel are both very important. Registrations of potential clients are important, since they provide a lot of information. Therefore, marketing campaigns are used. If the response is too low, the marketing campaigns are upscaled. The marketing communication starts with a website and a Facebook page and have regular communication tools. Marketing of complex housing projects provide more time and effort than standardized housing projects. The relation between the three different levels depends on the type of project and its context and the vision of the project development company. Limitations: The graduation process should be fulfilled in a time-frame of approximately nine months, which means choices need to be made about the demarcation of this research. Therefore, six case studies on real estate development projects and three case studies on marketing managers have been conducted. Tringulation is used to increase the validity of the findings of the case studies. Practical implications: A company’s success is often related to its marketing capabilities, however In Dutch real estate development practice marketing is an underexposed topic. Research on this relation might provide project developers with more insight and reflection on their working methods and it will cover a part of Dutch real estate development that has not been extensive executed yet. Originality/value: The relation between marketing and real estate development has not been described before. This research offers a perspective on the use of marketing by project developers in the Dutch residential sector.Key words: Marketing, Dutch residential sector, real estate development practice, marketing communication tools, end-user, corporate level","Marketing; Dutch residential sector; real estate development practice; end-user; marketing communication tools","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

SurGuide aims to improve the results of oral cancer surgery. The development of this product is relevant because each year around 300.000 new patients are worldwide diagnosed with oral cavity cancer. The primary treatment for oral cancer is surgery but mortality is high as the 5-yr survival rate after surgery is less than 50%.<br/><br/>The main goal of the surgery is to remove the complete tumor with a safe margin of healthy tissue around the tumor to be sure that the entire tumor is removed from the body. Nowadays, surgeons only use their feeling and visual capabilities to distinguish tumor from healthy tissue. This poor availability of equipment results in the fact that most of the times tumor is only partially removed from the body. This results in a poorer prognosis on quality of life for the patient. Technology is needed to support the surgeon. <br/><br/>Therefore this thesis focussed upon the design of a functional and user-friendly Raman-spectroscopic instrument for the rapid assessment of the surgical margin in a tumor, providing surgeons with adequate information to ensure complete tumor removal. Raman-spectroscopy is an optical technology, which can differentiate tumor from healthy tissue. <br/><br/>The chosen design approach consist out of four design phases. In the first phase, Discover, it is analysed what, according to surgeons and pathologists, is a functional and user-friendly guided surgery tool. It has been found that the optical fiber needle should penetrate the tissue while performing a Raman-spectroscopic measurement. The device should provide over 10 mm depth the margin with an accuracy of 1mm. Also, the positioning, repositioning and stabilizing of the probe onto the tissue should be comfortable and safe to the user. <br/><br/><br/>The second phase is called the Develop phase. In this stage and by means of creative methods, ideas have been generated. First, it has been decided to select a handheld design instead of a holder. A holder would be less user-friendly and would have more manufacturing complexities. Furthermore, it has been found that the user group prefers a small precision grip. Based upon these two initial decisions, two concepts have been proposed to potential users and the project team. These concepts differ in two ways 1) How the needle is moved into the tissue and 2) How the tool provides the distance between the needle-tip and the surface. In one concept, the needle is moved manually and the depth of the needle is determined by a distance scanner/sensor. In the other concept, a motor is selected which moves the needle into the tissue. This motor also controls the depth in which the needle is penetrated into the tissue.<br/><br/>The third phase has been the Experiment phase in which the concept are tested on their functionality and usability. Components are tested on its ability to determine the needle depth for 1 mm accurate. Also, various users tests with potential users show that preference goes to the concept with the motor. Also, by the insights obtained in the user tests, the form of the probe is made smaller and more pen shaped. The technique for this concept, the servo motor, can be used for the next prototype of the MarginGuide.<br/><br/>Also part of the Experiment phase, has been the tests of several prototypes. These tests were performed to provide a first suggestion on the manufacturability and maintainability of the probe.<br/>The prototypes demonstrated an option on how the motor inside the probe housing can be connected to facilitate the movement of the needle. This prototype shows the designed bar, which transfers the movement of the motor to the needle, can be an solution, however more engineering is required.<br/>Also, the maintainability of the device have been explored , focussing on the safe attachment of the needle to the probe. An option to attach and detach the needle safely is provided and tested on its feasibility. <br/>A mature, professional and attractive appearance is aimed for the MarginGuide. According to the insights of the test, the proposed design fits to this appearance. <br/> <br/>The final stage is called the Deliver phase in which a conceptual design is proposed. For further development of the MarginGuide, it is primarily important to focus on the influences on the Raman measurement and the needle depth determination, which may influence the accuracy of providing the margin. Important factors influencing the accuracy might be the ambient lights in the operation room and the differences in use.","Margin; Probe; Tumor","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","","","","","",""

Current design approaches lack a way of systematically designing the ergonomics of exoskeletons. Methods with a more pro active approach to ergonomics have to be developed. This thesis extends existing methods by which self aligning mechanisms are created with a systematic approach. A synthesis method is proposed by which all possibilities are synthesized. These possibilities are then excluded based on kinematic requirements on the system. The remaining possibilities are optimized based on ergonomic guidelines to obtain a set of solutions from which the designer can make well founded design choices. A force-deflection analysis was performed on the resulting solutions. This proposed method is applied to a planar passive exoskeleton for the shoulder. The method was successfully applied by using the total link length, reachable workspace, distance to the body and singularity avoidance as objectives for the optimization. Stiffness was added to the joints to obtain the required force-deflection behavior. The resulting objective values were verified by means of a prototype. The test results showed to be within reasonable bounds to verify the method for the planar case. The force-deflection analysis showed results that can be achieved by linear springs. This has to be verified by additional tests. The proposed method can be used as a tool in future exoskeleton design and can be extended with additional objective functions and constraints and can be extended to the three dimensional case.","Exoskeleton; Kinematic Synthesis; Ergonomic; Design; Compliant Mechanisms","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Due to malfunctions data servers might be erased or temporarily inaccessible. Different approaches using linear coding theory have been proposed in order to retrieve the content of erased servers from repair sets containing a selection of the remaining servers. This thesis focuses on comparing various repair methods for two erasures; disjoint parallel repair which protects each erasure by multiple disjoint repair sets, cooperative repair which uses a single repair set to repair all erasures at once and sequential repair which repairs erasures individually by using already repaired erasures. Coding inevitably induces storage overhead measured by the information rate. The applied method creates transmission overhead measured by locality, which concerns the number of servers accessed to perform erasure repair. The comparison mainly consists of appropriately computing minimal transmission overhead for these methods given a predetermined storage overhead. It is shown that Hamming codes have the best possible transmission overhead applying the cooperative method. The next best method is sequential repair, whereas disjoint parallel repair is too restrictive for two erasure repair with Hamming codes. For a generalized parity code it is demonstrated that the sequential method can repair more erasures than the disjoint parallel approach, and reach a better locality than the cooperative method. In general, the cooperative method eciently uses access to servers in order to reduce transmission overhead. For the same purpose, the sequential method uses already repaired servers allowing smaller repair sets to be accessed. In any repair process it is key to nd optimal combinations of a method and code which exploit these qualities. The cooperative method applied to Hamming codes and the sequential method combined with generalized parity codes prove to be high-ranking combinations in this regard.","","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Applied Mathematics","",""

With the increasing number of vehicles on the road, safety has become an important topic. The introduction of driver assistance systems, like Electronic Stability Control, has led to a significant decrease in fatal accidents. By preventing the vehicle from entering unstable behaviour, it remains controllable for the average driver. In rally racing, though, unstable manoeuvres, like drifting, are widely used for improved agility on low friction surfaces and in sharp corners. The average driver, however, is unable to perform such a manoeuvre safely.<br/><br/>With the development of autonomous driving systems, steps are taken to increase driver safety by removing the effects of human error. By taking over full control of the vehicle, these systems do not need to consider the driving skills of the average driver. Furthermore, the driving skills of the autonomous driving system are a result of its design. The autonomous driving system could, therefore, be designed to use advanced driver techniques, like drifting, to increase the safety of the passengers and other road users.<br/><br/>The objective of this research is to develop a vehicle controller that is capable of path-tracking within and beyond the limits of stable handling. To reduce the costs of testing, the controller is developed for an experimental platform in the form of a 1/10 scale radio controlled car. A nonlinear vehicle model of the scaled vehicle is developed and analysed regarding unstable vehicle behaviour. Since the behaviour and actuation of a vehicle differ in typical cornering and limit handling conditions, two separate controllers are used. In typical cornering conditions, a steering controller is used for path-tracking. Beyond stable limit handling, the lateral motion is actuated by both the steering angle and throttle input. A drift controller is used to determine the appropriate actuator inputs to sustain the drift, based on the yaw rate and direction of motion. The main contribution of this research is an extension of that controller to add path-tracking capabilities. Simulation analysis shows the controller can enter and sustain a drift, while successfully tracking the given path. Implementation of the controller in the scaled car shows great path-tracking performance in typical cornering conditions. Furthermore, the controller is able to, on command, make the vehicle enter sustain a drift.","Autonomous; drifting","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The developed algorithm performs heuristic topology optimization based on multiple criteria, in subsequent optimization cycles executed in series. In each ESO cycle, it is possible to perform material addition, removal or transition between a couple of materials, i.e. steel, concrete and void. Each optimization cycle is governed by an optimality criterion chosen from: stiffness, Von Mises, Drucker-Prager, tension stress criteria or linear interpolation of previous ones. The finite element analysis used in the algorithm regards all materials as linear elastic. The reaching of maximum strength and failure of materials is not taken into account.<br/><br/>The automated design process of reinforced concrete structures has been separated in two problems: the form-finding of reinforced concrete structure as a whole and the definition of internal distribution between steel and concrete. The first problem is solved, in the first optimization cycle, with a ``standard'' ESO procedure, with the only difference in choosing a Von Mises optimization criterion over a ``classical'' stiffness criterion. The second problem is solved, in the second and third optimization cycles, combining in series two additional ``modified'' ESO procedures and introducing gradual transition in optimization criteria through linear interpolation of sensitivity numbers. The combined criteria for the second cycle are a Von Mises and Drucker-Prager optimization criteria, while for the third cycle, a Drucker-Prager and tensile stress optimization criteria. Moreover, additional geometrical constraints are applied, to ensure a set minimal distance between steel and outer boundaries, i.e. concrete cover, and to ensure optimal angle preservation for steel members found during optimization, introducing two new ``density'' matrices called \emph{cover} and \emph{mask}.<br/>Summarizing, the preliminary design of reinforced concrete structures is dealt with three cycles of ESO optimization procedures executed in series, with optimization criteria that gradually change with continuity between the different cycles over the whole process.<br/><br/>The developed procedure has been tested on several case studies, both from ESO and reinforced concrete literature. The defined ESO process has been found to generate solutions with steel correctly placed in tensile stress zones both to resist bending and shear. Generally, the presence of remaining tensile stresses in concrete zones in the solutions is absent or very limited, and in latter cases their magnitude is very small compared to other stresses.<br/>Obtained solutions cannot be directly used as such for reinforcement layouts definition but, in combination with principal stresses plots and engineering judgement, they are able to suggest useful resulting reinforcement layouts.<br/><br/>As result of the specificities introduced for addressing the design of reinforced concrete structures, the ESO method has been extended for the case of topological optimization of composite materials with macro structure, with different optimization criteria applied to component materials, with one component material that has different resistance in tension and compression and with geometrical constraints for one component material.<br/><br/>The complete MATLAB code is published in the annex.","Evolutionary Structural Optimization; Bi-directional Evolutionary Structural Optimization; Computational Optimization; Topology Optimization; Structural Optimization; Heuristic Optimization; ESO; BESO; Optimization Algorithm; Optimization Procedure; Reinforced Concrete Structures; Reinforced Concrete Design; Reinforced Concrete","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This is a large charity that raises funds for cancer research in The Netherlands. Fundraising is done via a lot of different channels, one of which is door-to-door collection in the collection week. The annual KWF collection week is held in the first week of September and each year, KWF raises around 6 million euros. Yearly the efforts of the team behind all volunteers, ‘Team Volunteers’, increase, but still the total amount raised decreases. The goal of this graduation project is to increase the revenue of the door-to-door collection by (re)designing a product or system that decreases the barrier for donating. The project follows a design approach consisting of 3 main phases; exploration, creation &amp; reflection and implementation. The exploration phase starts with the internal research, which shows that KWF has extensive collection activities, and that the most important one, door-to-door collection takes up a lot of effort from almost 80,000 volunteers. Over the past years however, the collection revenue decreases. After looking closer at the numbers of the collection, it is found that remarkable differences can be found between different department sizes. This finding is the base of the differentiation of the departments on a demographic level that is made during the project. The qualitative volunteer research adds to the internal research findings that every volunteer experiences collecting differently. Again, big differences are found between collectors on a demographic level. Smaller villages and big cities differ a lot. This leads to the conclusion that ‘location’ is a very important factor. The internal research also shows that more factors are important during collecting, namely organisation, social pressure, behaviour and approach. The external research looks into a lot of different stakeholders and factors that have to do with the collection. First, the competition analysis shows that the ‘collection industry’ is very saturated and also quite competitive, while on the other side, charities work together on developing new collection products and share information. The most important stakeholder that is analysed is the donator. Psychological research shows that a lot of different factors play a role for people when deciding whether to donate or not. Some of the factors that play a role are the approach of the charity (or the collection method), the number of times people are addressed and the information that is provided. These are important factors that can be influenced by KWF directly, because factors like religion, age, work and income cannot be directly influenced. However, they can be used for targeting people with a certain message or a collection method. The analysis phase concludes that people can be targeted on a more personal level and demographic characteristics need to be used for this. The creation &amp; reflection phase starts with this subject and a new department classification for the volunteer departments of KWF is developed. Finally, five department types are created and the ‘large city’ type is selected for the design of a new collection method for KWF. A new collection location in the large cities is chosen as a design focus for a new collection method. ‘On the streets’ is the new design location and several opportunity fields are chosen as design directions. Six design elements are found that need to be designed for. These are location, communication, behaviour, product, organisation and training. The new collection method will address all these elements. Finally, a list of requirements and wishes is established providing the outlines for the design. Concept development is done after this. The final design of the new ‘street collection system’ is based on two different studies, a concept questionnaire and a real-life test. The new street collection system describes how to organise the street collection and which volunteers are needed for this. The volunteers receive the street collection package. In this package, information and physical material is provided for the perfect organisation and execution of the street collection. The message that is conveyed by the outfits of the collectors is: ‘I am a volunteer for KWF’. This message is based on the concept questionnaire and it adds to the integrity and trustworthiness of the volunteers. The volunteers also know how to communicate and behave and where to stand thanks to information cards and an instruction video. To make sure the new street collection system is implemented is the right way, an implementation plan is provided. This plan explains which phases to follow and what to do to improve the system. The report closes with a roadmap for the future of the collection of KWF. In the future, KWF will change its organisation and collection products in several ways in order to have a more successful collection. Several collection products need to be improved and provided in the form of collection packages. And all changes need to fit the different department types. The organisation and collection packages are tailored to the different target groups. The street collection system marks the start of many organisational and product changes for Team Volunteers. This new approach will allow KWF to increase the revenue and modernise the collection of the future.","Strategic product design; Collection; KWF Kankerbestrijding; Collection system; Future of collecting","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","","","","Strategic Product Design","",""

In commercial finite element packages two main options are available; using volume elements with interface elements between the pile and soil domains and the embedded beam approach. The embedded beam element was first proposed by Sadek and Shahrour (2004) and considers a beam element that can cross a solid element at any arbitrary location with any arbitrary inclination. This has several advantages to the volume pile method, such as the need for fewer elements and the mesh uncoupling of the pile and soil, which make this method much more efficient and leads to a significant reduction in calculation time. However, the embedded beam element also deals with a number of limitations and drawbacks. This research focuses on overcoming the mesh sensitivity, which is caused by the stress singularity that is introduced in the soil by the beam element. Also, the inability to take into account the pile surface will be resolved, aiming to improve the lateral pile-soil interaction.<br/><br/>The idea of Turello et al. (2016) of an embedded beam element with explicit interaction surface is extended and generalised leading to a new embedded beam formulation. In the proposed model the beam displacements at the interaction surface are obtained by a mapping scheme that takes into account Timoshenko beam theory and which is generalised to model inclined piles as well. A constitutive equation that describes the relation between the interface stresses and relative displacements between the pile and soil is defined along the shaft and at the foot of the pile. Along the shaft of the pile a shear stress limit is defined based on the Mohr-Coulomb failure criterion in order to incorporate plasticity in lateral direction. Furthermore, a more practical and efficient assembly procedure is proposed. <br/><br/>Validation of the proposed method proofs that the proposed model leads to a significant mesh sensitivity reduction in case of axially loaded models compared to the existing implementation. The overall response of laterally loaded piles is improved considerably as well. However, the proposed method is still unable to capture lateral interface behaviour in order to model soil slippage around the pile. Furthermore, it is recommended to formulate a generally applicable foot interface stiffness and to optimise the code in order to reduce the computation time. The description of the interaction surface opens up many new possibilities for future research, such as modelling the true cross-section shape. <br","Embedded beam element; FEM; pile foundations","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Nowadays, sustainable resources used for electricity generation are playing a more and more important role in the power system due to serious energy problems. Higher capability of power transmission and distribution thus becomes significantly necessary to keep the stability and reliability of the whole system. Instead of investing in new infrastructure, this thesis concentrates on existing HVAC power cables using XLPE insulation, trying to find out a way to improve their capability of power transmission without reducing their expected lifetime. <br/> For the purpose of utilization improvement, two models based on a realistic 132kV-XLPE power cable are developed first and then analyzed for AC, DC and combined voltages. Inspirations for creating voltage waveforms at an increased level, and thus improved capability of transmission are obtained from different field distributions in AC and DC voltage situations. The process of space charge development and the formation of the corresponding charge induced field is used in this work. <br/> Secondly, two kinds of hybrid voltage waveforms are created: trapezoidal and ones in shapes of sinusoidal and DC waves. Those types of waveforms are able to force the maximum electric field stress in XLPE to move within a small range, resulting in a higher utilization compared to the AC nominal voltage application. The optimal voltage waveform for the 132kV HVAC power cable is determined based on the highest rms value of voltage.<br/> Thirdly, for the suggested voltage waveform, sensitivities are evaluated for changing load levels, XLPE conductivity and the thermal conductivity of soil which depends on weather conditions. It turns out that the load level has highest sensitivity, followed by XLPE conductivity. Once the ampacity of the power cable is determined, the soil property needs little consideration. These important factors must be taken into account when designing the combined voltage waveform. <br/> Finally, cable terminations are modeled to check the feasibility to cope with the new waveform. The main conclusion is that: it is possible to apply the optimal waveform to existing high-voltage cables using SCT field grading technique in their terminals, while those terminations with stress cones may be endangered if higher voltages than the designed value are applied.<br/><br/>Keywords: cable insulation, space charges, electric field distribution, capacity improvement.<br","cable insulation; space charges; electric field distribution; capacity improvement","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2020-08-09","","","","Electrical Engineering | Electrical Power Engineering","",""

The Haringvliet ETD in the Southwest of the Netherlands is an extreme example of the latter: closing off the estuary in 1970 triggered a regime shift, completely altering the evolution of the ETD. Initially, the coastnormal sandy shoals evolved towards a narrow coast-parallel intertidal spit: the Hinderplaat. Subsequently, this tidal flat breached around 1995. Thereafter, the flat eroded continuously while sediment was transported from the flat towards the coast.<br/>Previous research with the aim to understand the morphological development of the Haringvliet ETD has provided insights into the processes that are responsible for the large morphological changes directly after the construction of the Haringvliet Barrier. The processes driving the observed ongoing erosion and flattening of the Hinderplaat are however still poorly studied and understood. Therefore in this research, the underlying mechanisms are investigated and linked with anthropogenic interferences and meteorologicalevents.<br/>To this end, a combination of data analysis and numerical simulations is applied. In an analysis of singlebeam bathymetry measurements (gathered in the Vaklodingen dataset), the development of the subtidal shoreface and the intertidal area of the Hinderplaat was explored. In general, the degradation of the Hinderplaat can be divided into three developments: (1) a landward migration since its formation, (2) a lowering since 1992 after a period of significant heightening and (3) a breach and channel formation in 1995, after which the shoal spread and merged with other shoals.<br/>A depth-averaged (2DH) Delft3D model is used to explore the mechanisms behind these developments and to reveal the relative importance of the tidal-, river discharge-, wind-, surge- and wave-forcing driving the flow and sediment transport in the ETD. The first two developments (landward migration and lowering) occurred gradually, hence they were possibly a response of the system to the regular hydrodynamic forcing. Various simulations with a wide range of forcing-scenarios are performed to evaluate this. The third development(breaching) was observed in the same year an extreme discharge had occurred. A morphodynamic hindcast is performed to study the link between the two.<br/>Model results indicate that the landward migration of the Hinderplaat was induced by regular wave action from WNW to NNE direction. Such wave conditions generate cross-shore transport over the shoal in eastern direction. This counteracts the effect of the tide, that enhances (much smaller) residual transport rates in seaward direction. Furthermore, breaking waves generate longshore transport along the Hinderplaat, with the highest transport rates at its southern end. This resulted in its spreading in southern direction and lowering of the highest part of the shoal. In addition, a correlation is found between the sudden increase in height of the Hinderplaat before the degradation and the construction of the Slufter. Considering the abundant transport rates from the Slufterdam towards the shoal, it is concluded that the port extension served as an important sediment source directly after construction. However, the sediment supply might have decreased in subsequent years. The hindcast simulation confirms that breaching of the shoal was a direct consequence of the high discharge event of February 1995: the strong offshore directed currents created an initial channel which was later on maintained by the tide.<br/>Wind-driven currents are very effective in generating residual flow patterns at the shoreface in front of the Hinderplaat. Besides, both the wind and surge act as important amplifiers for the sediment transport rates on top of the shoal. However, waves are indispensable for the morphological changes of the study area as the other hydrodynamic drivers are hardly capable of generating sediment transport by themselves.<br/>Concluding, it is undoubted that the formation and thereby existence of the Hinderplaat is a direct consequence of the man-made closure of the Haringvliet estuary. However, its degradation (lowering, landward migration, breaching and further spreading) is a response of the system to the natural hydrodynamic forcing. Therefore, this evolution can be considered as part of the intrinsic behaviour of the shoal that is independent of human interventions in the former estuary.<br","Morphodynamics; Delft3D; ebb-tidal delta; Haringvliet; Hinderplaat; Coastal morphology","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Hydraulic Engineering | Coastal Engineering","","51.887988, 3.996428"

To achieve this goal, it is necessary to improve the efficiency and to decrease the use of chemicals during pellet softening process. However, the model of Van Schagen et al. (2008 b,c) that is currently used to optimize the pellet softening process is not predicting accurately enough the pH and calcium profile over the height of the pellet softening reactor. The calcium carbonate crystallization is calculated, in this model, using a linear relationship between the rate of crystallization and supersaturation with an additional diffusion parameter to take into account the flow conditions inside the reactor. <br/>To determine more accurately the rate of calcium carbonate during the pellet softening process, two types of experiments were conducted during this research: STR batch and PFR fluidized bed experiments. Firstly, the experimental results were compared with the predictions of two linear models: the model of Wiechers et al. (1975) from literature and the one-rate-constant model developed in this research. Based on the results, it was concluded that it is not possible to improve the prediction of calcium carbonate crystallization kinetics if a linear model with one-rate-constant is used as proposed by Van Schagen. When the rate of crystallization is plotted against supersaturation a bending of the curve is observed at low supersaturation due to a sharp decrease in the rate of crystallization. Other researchers, such as Dreybrodt et al. (1997) has also observed that the rate of calcium carbonate crystallization is not linearly related to supersaturation when water or seeding material with inhibiting compounds is used. To describe this bending of the curve, two models were considered: the exponential model of Lasaga (1998) and the two-rate-constants model that consists of two linear equations. In this research, the two-rate-constants model was chosen instead of the exponential Lasaga model because it is easier to fit to the experimental results and gives a better overview of the dependence of the rate of crystallization from supersaturation. The two-rate-constants model significantly improves the prediction of calcium carbonate crystallization in a pellet softening fluidized bed reactor. The average relative error of this model, for the prediction of the calcium profile in a full-scale reactor, is only 2-5% while the average relative error of the one-rate-constant model is approximately 15-30%. Therefore, the two-rate-constants model predicts better the calcium carbonate crystallization and can be used to describe much more accurately the pellet softening process compared to the models found in literature.<br/>Based on the results of the research, it can be concluded that the performance of a pellet softening fluidized bed reactor cannot be significantly improved by increasing the height of the reactor. On the other hand, it is possible that performance is enhanced by removing inhibitors such as organic carbon from the water. Nevertheless, further research is necessary to determine the effect of inhibitors, such as organic carbon, on water softening. Also, in order to determine more accurately the model parameters, the experimental set up should be adjusted in order to represent better the conditions inside a pellet softening fluidized bed reactor. In particular, increasing the height of the reactor and mixing the caustic soda at the bottom of the column is necessary. <br/><br","calcium carbonate crystallization; Kinetic modeling; pellet softening process; fluidized bed pellet softening reactor","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Water Management","",""

Following the decision to design a house in northern Italy, the most direct and simple response to nature that could be proposed had to deal with the sun energy - which is abundant - and subsequently with the issues of orientation and thermal storage.<br/>The resulting proposal is for a single-storey house, occupying the smallest footprint possible in order to minimise any impact on the surrounding landscape, which design pays special attention to the orientation of the layout in order to exploit the sun energy to its fullest. Also, the main material chosen for construction is timber (both for structure and cladding), an environmentally friendly material which is able to give a ‘natural look’ to the construction.<br/>Usually a solar house utilises the sun energy through the mean of thermal mass. However the use of brick or concrete construction would result very chunky and would have a much bigger impact on the surroundings and on the embodied energy needed. In fact both brick and concrete have an higher embodied energy than timber, and this doesn’t have to do only with the manufacturing of the material but also with transportation and on-site construction, as heavier materials are more difficult to transport and to assemble. In order to avoid the problem of thick walls due to the use of thermal mass, the use of Phase Changing Materials is proposed. The considered embedding of this material in internal and external walls allows for the dwelling to maintain a constant temperature of around 23 degrees without the need of a central heating system most of the time, as PCM have a melting point temperature which is close to the thermal comfort needed by people.<br/>These materials are also embedded within a south facing glazed facade, which changes its aesthetics over time together with the changing state of the material. In fact, during the day when the PCM is melted the glazed facade allows views through to the exterior, while at night when the PCM freezes it creates a layer in between interior and exterior, obstructing the view. These ‘rituals of transformation supply syntax by rhythmically connecting our experiences to special places and activities in a dwelling.’2<br/>However, designing with nature is a difficult task; ‘buildings are subject to the same natural forces that have cause differentiation in nature, but they rarely acknowledge these forces in built form’3, which is what happened to this project. The dwelling in fact responds well to orientation issues in the layout of the different spaces, but it doesn’t in terms of shape and architectural representation, stuck in the archetypal form of the house, a rectangular shape with a pitched roof. On the contrary, ‘the concept of a building as an ecological form, differentiated in response to natural forces, points to a new aesthetics’.4<br/><br/>1 Ralph L.
