(mentor); Muller, T.H.J. (mentor); Baggen, J.H. (mentor)","2010","This master-thesis analyzes the deployment of congestion protection strategies to improve the bus running time through a specific case; an intersection in the city of Boston, United States of America. At this juncture two bus routes, operated by the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority (the transit authority), suffer from congestion impacting on their travel time. Different congestion protection strategies -strategies that procure a sense of priorityare evaluated using a micro-simulation program. The results are presented in terms of the travel time and the delay suffered by the transit vehicle and other vehicle classes. To implement the proposed strategies at the intersection an analysis of the policies and actors, technology, and management tools is perfomned. Throughout the analysis several aspects, which have limited the deployment of congestion protection strategies in the city of Boston, are identified. The research concludes that in order to implement congestion protection strategies a shift in perception towards the dependency to use private vehicles and old common practices of priority is to happen in the United States of America. Furthennore an improvement in running time for the bus is achieved when the traffic signal control -fixed timeis changed to vehicle actuated. The report is concluded with suggestions for further research.","public transportation; congestion protection strategies; transit signal priority; bus rapid transit; traffic signal control","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Delft University of Technology","Transport, Infrastructure and Logistics","","TIL","",""

(mentor); Yarovoy, A.G. (mentor)","2010","Imaging radar has become a keen research topic in recent years. UWB technology provides many advantages to imaging radar such as fine resolution and high power efficiency. The performance of a UWB imaging radar can be further improved by applying polarimetric diversity. The polarimetric signature of objects can be used to enhance the quality of target recognition. Like any other wireless systems, antennas are key factors of radar systems. The focus of this thesis is to develop a dual polarized antenna for UWB imaging radar. An antenna element was designed for the Ku-band and an impedance bandwidth from 8 GHz to 24 GHz was achieved. An orthogonal coax-to-coplanar transition has been developed during this project and this transition is used to feed the antenna element. The antenna elements are successfully applied in two different array configurations. It is demonstrated that these sub-arrays have over 100% fractional bandwidth, good impedance matching, linear phase (almost constant group delay) and uni-directional pattern. These aspects collectively account for the novelty in design. In future, these sub-arrays will be implemented inside a complete array structure of UWB imaging radar.","antenna; UWB; dual polarization","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Telecommunications","","","",""

(mentor); De Ridder, H. (mentor)","2010","Teleconsultation is a consultation between a doctor and a patient by means of video communication technology. It is a promising solution for the growing demand for health care. However, the medium has depersonalizing qualities. Emotions have an important role in doctor-patient relationship and are related to positive medical outcomes of consultations. Nonverbal behaviour is an important bearer of emotional messages. Nonverbal behaviour, like body posture and touching, are harder to distinguish. Therefore a product is designed for affective communication in teleconsultations, with focus on touch. A literature study has been performed on nonverbal affective communication in teleconsultations. Then a context analysis has been done by means of personas, interviews with specialists and an observational study on touching behaviour of patients during teleconsultations. The importance of the handshake at the beginning and end of a teleconsultation has been discovered and a virtual handshake has been developed. Different user studies gave a direction for the visualization of the handshake. Tactility, form and colour studies helped to design the input device and interface of the product. Finally the product is evaluated with a user test and evaluations with specialists. The product ‘Handmate’ is designed. The doctor and patient both have a pad. When the doctor and patient both put their hand on their pad, the screen will show a visualization of two figures shaking hands. The figures are designed for easy identification and friendly appearance. The doctor and patient can both initiate a handshake and decide on the duration of the handshake. The doctor can switch to the conversation mode, with a full screen webcam of the other person. The handshake product will give structure and clarity to the teleconsultation. It will help to establish rules of conduct for teleconsultations. The doctor and patient can greet each with the product. It will help to comfort the patient and it enables the doctor to show interest and empathy. The interaction between doctor and patient will become stronger and more personal.","design; video communication technology; teleconsultation; nonverbal communication; emotions; touch; handshake","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Industrial Design","","Master of Science Design for Interaction - Medisign","",""

(mentor); Pleysier, J.A. (mentor); Nijs, L. (mentor); Vambersky, J.N.J.A. (mentor)","2010","Als gevolg van stroming langs gebouwen ontstaat geluid, dat als zeer hinderlijk kan worden ervaren wanneer het een toon betreft. Dit tonaal geluid ontstaat onder andere door regelmatige wervelvorming achter constructiedelen, staande golven, en zogenaamde Helmholtzresonatoren. Een aantal notoire probleemgevallen op dit gebied haalden de afgelopen jaren uitgebreid de pers, waaronder de Hoftoren en het Strijkijzer, een tweetal hoogbouwprojecten in Den Haag. Uiteraard is deze problematiek niet aan de beroepspraktijk voorbijgegaan. Een veelvoud aan problemen op dit gebied is bekend; roosters blijken bovengemiddeld vaak aan de basis daarvan te staan. Van CFD wordt verwacht dat het, zeker op de langere termijn, ook nuttig kan zijn bij het oplossen van problemen met windgeluid. Wetenschappelijk onderzoek op dit gebied baseert zich op stroming rond objecten; het optreden van geluid is daarbij in eerste instantie een nevenverschijnsel. Belangrijk werk op dit specifieke gebied is verricht door Parker en, zeker in het geval van roosters, door Spruyt begin jaren ’70. Later relevant werk richt zich op het beschrijven van de stroming rond platen en het vinden van wetmatigheden aan de hand van het dimensieloze getal van Strouhal. In het kader van dit onderzoek zijn in de Open Jet Facility van de TU Delft windtunnelmetingen aan een aantal Dejo-roosters gedaan, die onderlinge verschilden in afwerking, maaswijdte en de dimensies van de draagstaven. Alle proefstukken leverden resultaat op in de vorm van tonaal geluid, soms al bij 8 à 9 m/s. Bij hogere snelheden bleef bij het verhogen van de windsnelheid vrijwel altijd onafgebroken een of meerdere tonen hoorbaar. De luidste fluittoon kende een geluidsniveau van ruim 110 decibel bij 25 m/s, met slechts 1m2 roosteroppervlakte. Een doorsnee proefstuk produceerde slechts onder enkele zeer specifieke hoeken tonaal geluid; een kleine wijziging van de hoek was dan voldoende om de toon volledig te laten verdwijnen waarna slechts nog ruis resteerde. De optredende tonen bleken verklaarbaar vanuit ten minste twee verschillende mechanismen. Bij het ene deel van de metingen neemt de frequentie geleidelijk toe bij het toenemen van de windsnelheid, en volgt daar een relatie volgens Strouhal. Een ander deel hangt sterk samen met de afmetingen van de roostermazen, waarbij de maaswijdte en dikte van een rooster (of mogelijkerwijs combinaties daarvan zoals een diagonaal) bepalend zijn voor de toonhoogte. De relevante afmeting is steeds gelijk aan meervouden van een halve golflengte; meerdere van dergelijk tonen kunnen tegelijkertijd optreden; het mechanisme is herkenbaar aan de constante toonhoogte over een range van windsnelheden. Waarschijnlijk betreft het zogenaamde Parker-modes. Nog niet beproefd zijn roosters met een sterk afgeronde voorzijde, of maatregelen voor het tegengaan van het tonaal geluid bij roosters.","windgeluid; rooster; Parker; Spruyt; tonaal","nl","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Design and Construction","","","",""

(mentor)","2010","This project focuses on developing a parallel Navier Stokes simulator capable of modeling single phase dispersion in porous media at the pore scale. Many different factors can contribute to dispersion on a pore scale and this study was limited to fluid flow related factors. The model, including convective motion and diffusive (Fickian) spreading, also incorporates the influences of gravity, inertia and viscous forces on the motion. The precise interaction between these forces and the way these interactions contribute to dispersion is not fully understood from a theoretical point of view. In order to gain insight into dispersion, pore scale simulations are performed in a domain consisting of a few grains. The primary objective of the project was to investigate whether the parallel computational power of NVidia graphics cards (GPUs) could be utilized to tackle the computational intensive Navier Stokes equations. Mainstream NVidia graphics cards (GPUs) appeared to be unable to model the system of equations due to hardware limitations and in addition a conventional parallel processor (CPU) code was developed. Based on a small sample of simulations, diffusion appears to be a significant factor controlling the distribution of the tracer. Inertia may also play a significant role, depending on the alignment relative to pore geometry and gravity. For the case we consider gravity appears to have the least influence on dispersion.","dispersion; tracer; simulation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Section Petroleum Engineering","","","",""

(mentor); Balz, V.E. (mentor); Stead, D. (mentor); Smit, P. (mentor)","2010","Contemporary city-regions are facing major challenges concerning the relation between mobility and urbanity. A concrete example of this is the phenomenon of urban sprawl, which evolved in the US and also in Western Europe. The car is a very popular mode of transportation. However, the automobile has some serious spatial consequences. It had a major role in the spatial planning practice of our environment the last decades. In fact, the automobile can be named as an unsustainable mode of transportation and its popularity has some major spatial consequences. The planning challenge for the future is therefore to tune the issues of infrastructure, accessibility and spatial developments for the development of sustainable city-regions. However, the development of a sustainable city-region is asking for a package of measures. Spatial planning and strategy is one of the parts that can contribute to the development of sustainable city-regions. A city-region whereby this relation between mobility and urbanity is very specific and urgent is the Utrecht-region. This region functions as an important connecter between the Randstad and the hinterland. The region is under pressure for several reasons. First, there are significant housing shortages in the region. Moreover, these housing shortages are increasing in the future, despite the fact that a lot of new dwellings are being built. Next to this, there are problems in the region concerning its accessibility. Capacity problems in the regional public transport system and congestion problems on the road network are the daily examples. The challenge hereby is to search for a suitable spatial strategy to deal with the relation between mobility and urbanity. For the Utrecht-region, a strategy has to be found to deal with the housing shortages and the accessibility of the region at the same time. The specific goal for the Utrecht-region is to boost the region’s comparative advantages, to maintain its spatial qualities and strengthen the position of the region in the Randstad. A spatial concept that integrates spatial development and public transport is the concept of transit-oriented development (TOD). The goals of TOD appear on the regional and the local scale. In this research and design the focus is on the regional goals of TOD. Interactions and movements of people in space mostly occur on this specific scale level. Station areas can be named as nodes of human interactions and are therefore of great importance in spatial planning. In that way station areas are important objects of research. In this project the research of station areas is done with the node-place model of Bertolini. The node-place model addresses the ambivalent character of station areas: a (regional) node in the public transport system and a (local) place in the city. With the application of this model for the Utrecht-region, the potentials and opportunities of all the existing, planned and possible new stations are analyzed. In this way, the node-place model is supporting the design decisions made in the regional design proposal for the Utrecht-region. Every station area is proposed to develop in a certain direction, for the development of the Utrecht-region in a transit oriented way. Both, potentials of station areas and regional design goals were principal in the development of the design and strategy. Simultaneously with the research and design of the station areas, the public transport system of the Randstad is restructured. New layers of public transport are introduced: the e.g. interregional system and an agglomerative system. For a horizontal and vertical integration of public transport it is necessary to switch between different levels of scale. The integration between spatial developments and the (agglomerative) public transport system was hereby an important goal. If the regional design for the Utrecht-region is compared with the current municipal plans some remarkable differences appear. Planned development locations by the different municipalities are often not located near high-quality public transport like, light rail or traditional heavy rail stations. An example is the major extension area of Rijnenburg, located in an area with a very poor access to public transit. In the proposed regional design for the Utrecht-region, spatial developments are mostly concentrated within a 600 meters catchment radius of a traditional station area. The allocation of spatial developments near the station areas will lead to a major reduction of the housing shortages in the Utrecht-region. The development of the different station areas in a certain typology has led to a less dominant position of Utrecht Centraal. It is no longer a matter of Utrecht Centraal, and all the other of the stations without major differences. The concentration of spatial developments around transit as proposed in this research and design will probably lead to a decrease of the demand for mobility of people. The concept of transit-oriented development will lead to less car dependency and a bundling of movements in the Utrecht-region. The application of this concept for the Utrecht-region requires a major effort of the different stakeholders. The BRU could have a facilitating and steering role in this development process. The integration of the different aspects of planning, e.g. regional development, public transport and nature is thereby essential.","city-regional design","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Architecture","Urbanism","","","",""

In this research, a finite element (FE) model of the combined Wells and Darrieus water turbine is developed. This model is verified with strain gauge measurements of the prototype that is running in open sea conditions. The results of the finite element analysis are discussed and used to analyse the performance and the structural design of the prototype. In 2020, an expected 3 GW of ocean energy turbines will be installed worldwide. Several studies have already focused on the conversion of tidal or wave energy into electrical energy. In the beginning of 2009, a unique prototype water turbine called the CEnergyWave Rotor was built and installed in theWesterschelde River, The Netherlands. This vertical axis water turbine is able to convert both tidal and wave energy into electrical energy, using a rotor that consists of Darrieus and Wells blades. The Darrieus blades are powered by tidal currents and waves (water particles that move back and forth), whereas theWells blades are powered by the up and down moving water particles. The Wave Rotor can be attached to offshore wind turbine support structures where it increases the total power production using the same grid. In order to be competitive with other renewable energy systems, cost reduction should be the objective of the design. In this research a hydrodynamic force model is used which is based on the blade element momentum theory and verified with the results of a prototype rotor in laboratory environment. Using this verified model, forces are applied to the developed FE model of the rotor. Strain gauge measurements from the running wave rotor in open sea conditions are then used to verify the correctness of the combination of both theoretical models. After verification, the models are used as a simulation tool to estimate the fatigue life of the rotor blades for different scenarios. It turns out that the combination of the two models gives reliable estimates for the occurring stresses. With this result, the structural design of the Wave Rotor blades can be optimized for any site condition and expected life time.","Windenergy","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","Aerodynamics & Wind Energy","","Sustainable Energy Technology","",""

The Superscalar and VLIW machines are designed to exploit the ILP available in applications. These architectures improve performance by executing multiple independent instructions in parallel. However, this model faces some serious challenges, such as data hazards, and limited number of independent instructions that can be executed in parallel. The Scalable Compound Instruction Set Machine(SCISM), also referred to as Superscalar Instruction Set Machine, proposes solutions for many of these challenges. The SCISM approach can be applied both to Complex Instruction Set Computer (CISC) and Reduced Instruction Set Computer (RISC) machines. SCISM performs a run-time analysis of decoded instructions to determine on the fly when they can be executed in parallel or not. This analysis is based on a predefined set of instruction compounding rules. Rules categorize instructions based on their hardware utilization. SCISM, furthermore, features interlock collapsing hardware, which can eliminate certain instruction interlocks, and often allows to execute in parallel instructions with real data hazards. Another important property of SCISM is that it is compatible with the existing instruction sets, thus, it does not require binary any code recompilation or translation. In this work we have analyzed the IA-32 Instruction Set Architecture (ISA) with respect to compounding. The instruction categorization and compounding rules are applied to this ISA. The experiments are performed using Bochs x86 emulator implementing in-order execution. Very simple two-way instructions compounding is used, where the maximum of instructions that can be executed in parallel equals two. Experimental results, with SPEC CPU2006, demonstrate that such simple scenario the number of instructions executing in parallel varies from 13% to 24% for integer benchmarks and from 1% to 26% for floating-point benchmarks.","SCISM; ILP; superscalar; IA-32; CISC; RISC","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2010-02-17","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Microelectronics & Computer Engineering","","","",""

A prototype of this mechanism has a range of motion of +25 and -22 degrees with a steering stiffness at the handle side of 18Nmm/rad. An axial load of 200N on the tip corresponded with a parasitic deflection of 4 degrees.

This research project has investigated the technological and socio-economical feasibility of the concept in addition to possible implementation strategies by answering the following research question: To what extent can the concept of The Sustainable Highway provide a technologically and socio-economically feasible solution to the negative side effects of road traffic and how could The Sustainable Highway be successfully implemented given the institutional context? From a technological perspective, The Sustainable Highway is a feasible concept. Technological systems which are applied in the concept are to a large extent proven and an independent second opinion endorses the advantages which Movares claims to offer with this concept. Although several technological uncertainties remain, on the whole the concept provides a technologically feasible alternative to common practices such as a noise barriers or a tunnel. The socio-economic feasibility of the concept depends on the location in which it will be realised. The possibility for spatial development and the revenues from building land form a large component of the benefits the concept can achieve. Therefore, when The Sustainable Highway is realised on a highway running through a densely populated urban area, where local residents experience severe hindrance from noise and air pollution and where building land can be developed in the area, it is a socio economically feasible alternative. From an institutional perspective, there has to be a window of opportunity in order to successfully introduce the concept, and the institutional context should not pose additional limitations to the concept. Gaining the support of local parties and forming a consortium of private parties which is able to realise The Sustainable Highway are the first steps towards implementing the concept into its institutional context.","The Sustainable Highway; cost-benefit analysis; institutional analysis; technological feasibility; socio-economic feasibility","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Technology, Policy and Management","Transport Policy and Logistics Organisation","","SEPAM","",""

Offshore Oil and Gas platforms and Wind parks (manned / unmanned) have strict and tight requirements for robust communication. Robustness of communication networks can be evaluated by the analysis of either transmission networks on the physical layer or by the network protocols and techniques run over the transmission network on higher layers. Offshore Oil and Gas facilities aim for continuous production to achieve the desired goals and a robust transmission network is very important to avoid production losses. In general, offshore transmission networks last for longer periods, which means transmission technologies must be robust with maximum availability against repair and replacement time and costs to evade interruptions, especially in catastrophic situations. But in reality a network can face multiple of problems, which can halt or interrupt communication for seconds, minutes, hours and in some cases days. In this thesis, the robustness of offshore transmission networks for Oil and Gas facilities is evaluated for normal and catastrophic situations to avoid maximum disruptions in communication by comparing three technologies (Optical, Microwave LOS, and Satellite communication) in terms of availability, repair and replacement time and costs, and by applying network graph theory to overcome technological differences. The results of the analysis show that the offshore transmission technologies have some predetermined trends, impacts and risks associated with different kind of manmade and natural hazards at different geographic locations, which can be prevented by applying network graph theory with a combination of transmission technologies for both normal as well as catastrophic situations. This thesis highlights the importance of robustness related to repair and replacement time and costs due to catastrophic calamities and will serve offshore industry to make an efficient decision while designing or extending transmission networks for offshore Oil and Gas facilities.","Offshore Comunication; Robust transmission networks; Algebraic connectivity","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2010-01-30","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Telecommunications","","Master of Science","",""

(mentor); Teeuwsen, H.J.L.C. (mentor); Gielen, M.A. (mentor)","2010","This report describes a graduation report for Stichting Bio kinderrevalidatie on the nature experience of children with physical disabilities. It starts with a contextmapping research into the nature experience of children at the terrain of bio and concludes with a design to improve the nature experience of the children. Assignment The terrain of Bio in Arnhem is being redeveloped as a holiday location. Currently the surroundings of the premises are being adapted to facilitate play. The terrain is surrounded by a forest, which is not used much at the moment. Bio wonders how the nature experience of the children that stay at the resort can be improved. Therefore they would like to have an object to be placed on their terrain which lets the children experience nature in a playful way. Analysis To gain insight in the group of users at the Bio terrain and their view on nature and playing outdoors a contextmapping study was set up. Several user groups were involved in this study. The study aimed at answering research questions that were set up in order to come to a valuable design direction. From the research could be concluded that To the participating children nature is virtually everything that is outside. The children do not know much about nature itself, but enjoys being taught on the subject. Some of the children only get in contact with nature when their teachers take them. The children have different attitudes towards nature. While one can see the beauty of things and talks about nature in that way, others just see play possibilities in digging holes and biking on difficult paths. Outdoors most of the children enjoy being active: riding a bike, go-kart or playing games like hide-and-seek or tag. Children in wheelchairs can not always participate, but the children that express they want to participate are helped as much as possible. Jumping on the trampoline is something all children can and like to do. The children who are in a wheelchair lie down on the trampoline to feel the movement of the others. The children always need supervision at the activities they do outside and there is always a caregiver present. The children enjoy playing together. This usually goes well depending on the personalities of the children. Generally children of the same intellectual level bond and will play together. Design From the analysis was concluded that a design that offers play possibilities for all children on the terrain would be designed. The group of children at the Bio terrain was based on the analysis phase divided into three groups. The division of these groups was based on cognitive abilities. With these three groups in mind idea sketches were made. From these sketches 3 ideas were chosen to be developed into concepts. One of these concepts was chosen to be developed into the final design; het Bio Belevingen Bos (The Bio experience forest). The design of the Belevingen Bos consists of different elements or experiencing and doing. The elements are grouped in the forest to provide nature experiences to all children. The Belevingen bos has a central space with a bench from where the parents can watch their children. From the bench there are routes to the other elements in the forest. There are trays in which children can collect and play with natural materials they find in the forest. With bigger materials the children can build their own natural landscape in the ‘build’ area. Three cabins across the terrain offer sensorial experiences like vision and sound, and can get the children in contact with nature by watching birds.","Children; Contextmapping; Nature experience","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Industrial Design","","Master of Science Design for Interaction","",""

(mentor); Brezet, J.C. (mentor)","2010","Worldwide there is large need for off-grid refrigeration, above all to cool food and medicaments. The existing market is large and varied with well established premises. Technology can be applied, sun is available and electricity lacks where it is needed. Shop owners, home users and the medical industry reveal interest for cooling and, although their needs differ, one thing is in common: it must be low-cost. Solar cooling technologies have to compete in performance, practicality, availability, environmental friendliness and cost, against generator powered Vapor-Compression Refrigerators and Diffusion-Absorption technologies, both running on fossil fuels. As for the competition on environmental aspects, a long runtime will be in favor of a solar system. The comparison and selection of the appropriate cooling and energy collecting techniques is discussed in this document as well as the problem of autonomous function and energy transportation. A solar sorption ice-maker was found to be the cheapest and most viable solution. The different options for this product are reviewed and through several phases of design, a new concept of a solar sorption refrigerator is developed. From the development of a low-cost system solutions can derive from the most basic needs and develop further towards more convenient solutions, resulting in a scalable and modular set of solutions. The design proposal is an innovative product for the solar cooling market. Its unique feature of being detached from the cool-box makes it flexible in use. The essential parts of the product are produced as continuous profiles and assembled at the destination region to a refrigeration system. This approach hosts an unseen freedom of different refrigeration products for the most versatile uses. Improvement was suggested at this level and on what counts for the environmental impact. As determined in the life cycle assessment, the product has adequate properties for recycling and reuse, but certain materials need to be reconsidered. Conclusively the product fulfills the initial idea and shows promising opportunities.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","2011-01-28","Industrial Design Engineering","DFS","","Master of Science Integrated Product Design","",""

This linear imaging system comprises one linear photodiode array and two readout modes: the integration mode and the coherent detection mode. The integration mode is applied when the leakage current is much smaller than the photocurrent, which increases the SNR by long integration time and improves the dynamic range by variable integration time control. The coherent detection mode is applied when the leakage current is comparable with the photocurrent, which aims at reducing the error caused by leakage current.

(mentor); Van Loon, P.P.J. (mentor)","2010","The TU Delft and Port of Rotterdam have developed a management information system for integrated port area development. The instrument is an interactive 3D computer based simulation system that helps decision makers to explore a wide problem-space. The computer is used for a larger information processing capacity the user’s judgement is needed for the decision making. The system can be used to assess the spatial and financial feasibility of the different aims of all those involved at an early stage. The use of the system encourages the different contracting parties to become involved in each other’s concerns. Integrated port area development is a way of adjusting the constructed areas to the (continuously) changing demands and needs of the port sector and society. Achieving the quantitative and qualitative aims and ambitions set during the integrated port area development process demands interaction and cooperation between involved departments of the Port of Rotterdam and extern parties. A pilot area (Waalhaven-Zuid) has been chosen to develop and evaluate this instrument. It covers 100 ha and is a part of the eastern ports of Rotterdam. This area will become the scene of a large-scale transformation process into a mixed area for port activities, housing and working. Increased and more efficient commercial use of space in the port area is the main goal. This can be done by sharing facilities and utilities, innovative building, co-siting and multi-use of space for example. Such adjustments lead to intensification of use of space. In preparation crucial information regarding the current use of space is entered into the system. This information consists of the function, volume and ownership of the buildings, plots, infrastructure and public areas. During the simulation session different volumes of the buildings, infrastructure and public areas are added, modified and/or removed (steering). This is done by looking at the preferred future use of space, the costs and the profit and the planning involved. The system then immediately calculates the effect of the alternative courses of actions or solutions, on a financial and spatial level. The system output is automatically generated and presents the following results: 3D view area, programme, a set of density variables (Floor Space Index, Ground Space Index and Open Space Ratio) and a financial overview. This thesis is relevant for those (professionals and scholars) interested in science and area development, for students, for advisors, for real estate developers, for civic servants, project leaders and board members.","decision","nl","master thesis","","","","","","","","2010-01-27","Architecture","Real Estate & Housing","","","",""

(mentor); Creusen, M.E.H. (mentor)","2010","This project is executed for the department Campina Dagvers of the company FrieslandCampina. Campina is one of the largest brands in daily fresh dairy in the Netherlands. Unfortunately the sales are decreasing due to the rise of the private labels of supermarkets. In this project a new product is developed to strengthen the market position of Campina. Campina’s strengths lie in their cooperative set-up and segmented products. Together 17.000 farmers own the company FrieslandCampina. The company controls the whole value chain; from the raw milk of the cow, to the filled packaging in the supermarket. The segmented products of Campina, like Boerenland and Calcium Plus, that target a specific group of consumers perform best. The basic dairy, like semi-skimmed milk and yoghurt, mainly suffer from the competition of private label. Opportunities for new product development are found in recent trends. Several sets of trends are identified. The trends of the Dutch governmental institution EVD and of brand consultant Clear are chosen because of their Dutch origin. These two sets of trends are the starting point of the detected search areas. The products of FrieslandCampina and competing dairy brands are mapped according to the trends of EVD; ‘convenience’, ‘functional’, ‘organic’ and ‘regional’. Many products fit in two directions, for example Vifit fits in both ‘convenience’ and ‘functional’. None of the products fits in both ‘organic’ and ‘regional’. A product combining these two directions could be positioned here. This product, named ‘Pure’, is further defined as a product that is pure (no additives) and close to the origin. Clear mapped the current brands of Campina by the characteristics ‘enjoyment’, ‘belonging’, ‘functional’ and ‘power’. In this mapping a gap can be identified in the area between ‘power’ and ‘enjoyment’. A product concerning Vitality could be positioned here. This product is further defined as a drink for sports men. Emphasis will be on the product intrinsic benefits of dairy for sports men. Vitality is considered as a very innovative and commercial feasible direction. The pressure on social aspects is low and the trustworthiness of Vitality is high because the benefits are easy to understand for most consumers. Therefore there was chosen to further develop this product. The result is called ‘Dynamilk’: a refreshing dairy drink in a 0,5L bottle specifically for sports men. Dynamillk is for people who play sports on a regular basis, in the Netherlands this group has the size of 6.5 million people. The drink offers many functional benefits which originate in the basic ingredients of milk. The vitamins and calcium are optimal for bones and muscles. The protein will give the sports men a good feeling about building muscles or recovering them and the potassium benefits the hydration process. The taste will be like a fresh yoghurt drink, to improve taste the product should be cooled before served. The drink will be long-perishable by room temperature. Dynamilk will be an individual brand, though Campina will be displayed as the umbrella brand. In this way both brands can profit from each other. The marketing and sales of Dynamilk will be assigned to Campina Dagvers, although the product is technically not fresh but only has the desired image to be fresh. Before Dynamilk can be implemented the product needs to be further developed by food scientists. The packaging should be optimized and made ready for production. Promotional activities are needed towards middleman (supermarkets, wholesalers, sports facilities) as well as directly towards the consumer. The sales team of Campina Dagvers will be responsible to create accounts at supermarkets, wholesalers and sports facilities. Besides their own experience in the daily fresh dairy field they can make use of the experience in the field of sports drinks of the brand Extran, which is also a product of FrieslandCampina. The consumer needs to be attracted by promotional activities. Dynamilk should gain brand awareness by sponsoring a large typically Dutch sport, sports event or sports men. The product can best be introduced in September 2010.","design; dairy; campina; milk; sport","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Product Innovation Management","","Master of Strategic Product Design","",""

After initial exploration the graduation assignment was defined as: “Design a tool that improves the effectiveness of virtual design teams through facilitation of creating shared understanding”. The project was executed at the TU Delft with a design through research approach. Throughout the project, users have received our primary focus — this is expressed by the three rounds of interviews with potential users. The project was setup in three general stages: In the first stage the context was analyzed through a literature review on the topics of collaborative design, the high performance of radically colocated design teams and current tools and technologies, and a number of interviews with designers involved in virtual team work. Then, a preliminary concept was developed, and explored in in-depth interviews with target users. These interviews were supported by the concept which was presented as a storyboard. And finally, an improved concept was developed using the results and insights from the first concept exploration. This improved concept has been materialized in a interactive prototype which formed the basis for a last round of interviews with potential users. The resulting product-concept “project i/o” is a tool which allows team members participating in a project to share, and to acquire knowledge. Team members can share their status of what they are working on and the artifacts they produce — the external representations of their knowledge — with others. In return they receive awareness of what others are working on and awareness of their availability.","CSCW; collaborative design; design research; storyboard testing","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Computer Aided Design Engineering","","Master of Science Design for Interaction","",""

ARIS is as Business Process Analysis (BPA) tool adequate for analyzing and designing business processes, while the execution and monitoring of these processes is empowered by Cordys as Business Process Management Suite (BPMS). The challenge is to enable iterative round-trip modelling across these two tools. Event-driven Process Chains (EPC) and Business Process Modelling Notation (BPMN) have established themselves as the most used modelling languages in the industry. Coupling ARIS and Cordys involves 1) transforming the high-level business process models in EPC developed in ARIS into executable process models in Cordys BPMN, and 2) ensuring round-trip development by means of interoperability. This thesis proposes a conceptual framework to couple a BPA and BPMS tool for round-trip business process modelling. The framework utilizes concepts from the Model Driven Architecture for structural addressing interoperability and model transformations. Business process models are developed and assessed from high-level, operational and technical viewpoints. Depending on the level of interoperability wished for, different types of model transformations within and between these viewpoints apply. Ensuring interoperability with traceability may allow maintaining the perception on the real world with different viewpoints. The framework is applied on the ARIS and Cordys case. Analyzing and comparing the tools have given insight on type of models, the information for exchange, and where possible coupling points are. Model transformations are defined for EPC and Cordys BPMN models. Results of the framework provide a foundation on how to achieve interoperability between ARIS and Cordys.","Business processes; BPM; SOA; model transformations; MDA; workflow patterns; ontology","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2010-01-27","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Computer Science Information Architecture","","","",""

An old farm in the small village of Ormoy in the North-East of France, has been chosen for this project. “This village is well suited to take maladjusted youth to, because it is an environment with low stimuli. The house is on the outskirts of the village so it won’t disturbe the neighbours too much.” SEPARATING SLEEPING & TREATMENT. The pressure on the youth to be treated can be very high. To help the youth take some distance from the treatment, there is a physical separation between the treatment and the sleeping. There are two buildings in which these two functions take place, with a separating garden in between. In the Sleeping-Building the architecture will play an active role in the treatment. And in the Treatment-Building the architecture will play a passive role. REWARD PROGRAM. When the youngster enters the project he or she will always start in the first room. It has a simple staircase leading up to the room. From the public space boxes in different colors can be seen can be seen. This box impersonates you. All you need is inside this box. In the first room this is only a desk, closet and a bed. In the second box you will get more facilities like a wash basin. This process continues. So the box grows with you.","Youth; reward; program; maladjusted","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2011-02-03","Architecture","Architecture","","Explorelab","",""

(mentor); Bilow, M. (mentor)","2010","The world today is struggling with several problems concerning the environment to which the building industry is contributing especially by pollution and resource depletion. This research calls for optimizing the way facades are constructed and materialized, in order to limit these problems. For this optimization to be accepted there has to be a convincing reason to replace conservative means. This thesis offers insight in the facade’s contribution, obtained by a literature study and an impact assessment that can be seen as the main reason. The base of a sustainable façade design is the honest intention to do so and stick with it. The next step is to adopt a holistic perspective that involves all disciplines in a continuous discussion throughout the design phase and during the use phase when upgrades or maintenance is needed. The design should have an adaptable layout that enables these upgrades serving state-of-the-art technique and user requirements. Moreover the basic construction is best kept general in order to prolong the façade’s life span. Finally the façade’s environmental impact is minimized by closing material loops and choosing renewable resources. The high performance of state-of-the-art facades is partly dependent on their materialization. Aluminium, plastics and insulation glass are examples of this materialization that at the same time has a high environmental impact. The façade’s components that relatively have the highest environmental impact include the load bearing construction and the transparent area. These materials and components should therefore be designed with extra care in order to achieve an excepted environmental impact without compromising in performance.","facade; environmental impact","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2010-01-30","Architecture","Building Technology","","","",""

(mentor)","2010","There are noticeable issues related to the traditional method for software engineering, perhaps the most significant being the current cost and time to market of software systems. Microsoft's Software Factories (SF) confront these problems. A tool that supports creating SFs is the Microsoft Tools for Domain-Specific Languages (DSL Tools), which allows developers to define a modeling language, generate visual designers and transform models, that are described in custom modeling languages, to code. It does not provide any means for testing the transformation process from model to code, so that testing boils down to repeatedly executing the code generation with a variety of input. A proposed method for improving the testing process is to build a tool that provides support for testing the code generation process. In this report, we describe how we built a tool that automatically builds input testmodels for SFs, optimizes generated test sets based on predicted test quality, supplies tests to a SF and generates a log-file based on the results of the testing process. Then, several methods for qualifying the quality of generated tests are proposed, which are based on coverage criteria. After that, we illustrate the results of a case study where the effectiveness of the automated test generation approach is tested, as well as the performance of coverage criteria in predicting test set quality. Twelve errors were exposed in the SF under test, most of these being robustness errors which appear difficult to find using traditional testing approaches. In addition, testing the performance of coverage criteria indicated that there was a relation between metamodel coverage and the number of errors found and that, of all proposed coverage criteria, average metamodel coverage was the best predictor for test quality. Finally, we conclude that automated test generation is a promising approach for improving the testing process for SFs.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2010-04-01","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Software Engineering","","Computer Science","",""

(mentor); Hermans, W.J.A. (mentor)","2010","This Master thesis deals with metro station environments in the district Amsterdam Zuid-Oost. The metro is one of the main public transport modes in the district, however these station environments are not well integrated in the neighbourhoods. Often these areas are neglected and seem forgotten, while travellers need to face these environments daily. On top of this the district does not have a very good image, this is due to both urban morphological and social issues. The district was designed according modernistic ideals, functions were separated which allows minimal interaction. Roads are elevated and have hierarchical network characteristics, causing even less interaction between urban elements and public space users. A lot of undefined public space is created due to elevated infrastructure, these dark and unpleasant environments are associated with illegal businesses. And these businesses do exists, because the district is dealing with a high rate of crime and drugs dealing. And at the same time the district has a lot of unemployed inhabitants. In this Master thesis I have tried to find design guidelines or design concepts which can be used to integrate a metro station with its surrounding neighbourhood in order to create a lively, attractive and useful metro station environment. The strategy follows: redevelopments around metro stations can function as hubs to structuralize the urban environment. This stimulates the urban coherence and interdependence of the district. Design recommendations for the district were taken from practical research and theoretical principles of Salingaros (2005), while on the neighbourhood scale guidelines were analysed of Transit Oriented Development (TOD) (Calthorpe, 1993) also case studies were done to find design references. Next key-projects were chosen to develop design proposals for and four design concepts were concluded: the pedestrian defined grid city, mix of functions, higher densities around station and smaller plot sizes which are the fundamentals of integrating a metro station with its surrounding neighbourhood.","metro station environments; metro station redevelopment","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Architecture","Urbanism","","","",""

This fast renewal has lots of positive effects and the living standard is increasing each day. In the Architecture however we see the tendency of building high dens and large scale buildings, not only designed by Asian architects, but for a great part designed by western architects. My thesis focusses on the question if it is possible to create a small scale architecture in Asia, which can fulfill the modern needs. Melaka The town of Melaka is put on the list of UNESCO world heritage meaning that if a building collapses it has to be rebuild with the same architectonic principles. However, this might turn Melaka into a ‘open air museum’, making it loose its qualities of micro economies and family businesses. I see a chance to rebuild a broken shophouse in a modern way, but sticking to the basic architectural qualities of the shophouse. In some ways the goal is to extract fragments from the historical form and simplify them, in order to apply them later freely on adapted to some contemporary global necessities. Typological Research In order to find these principles a typological research is made to find the basic architectural qualities of the shophouse. All shophouses are researched over time, and important qualities are found. The shophouses, for example, are all build in basic Chinese proportions, consist an ‘air-well’ and have ‘screens’ to separate public and private space.These principles are simplified and applied in the design.","shophouse; basic; minimalism","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2010-01-26","Architecture","Explorelab","","","",""

(mentor); Kamerling, M.W. (mentor)","2010","Zonne- en windenergie worden sinds enige tijd op steeds grotere schaal toegepast. Nederland wordt steeds een stukje groener, echter zijn we er nog lang niet. Zowel qua hoeveelheid opgewekte energie als techniek om duurzame energie op te wekken. Het zonlicht hebben we inmiddels succesvol weten om te zetten middels zonnecellen in energie. Zij het dat ook deze techniek nog in de kinderschoenen staat. Windenergie maakt de laatste jaren ook een flinke opmars, kijk onder andere naar het windmolen park nabij Egmond aan zee dat onlangs is opgeleverd. Momenteel is de overheid bezig nog meer van deze projecten in de Noordzee te realiseren. De techniek van windmolen generatoren heeft inmiddels al een aantal verbeteringen ondergaan en wordt dan ook steeds rendabeler. Maar er is nog 1 grote bron van energie die wij vooralsnog onbenut laten, golfenergie. Met 2 – 3 kW/m2 in tegenstelling tot windenergie 400 – 600 W/m2 en zonne-energie 100 – 200 W/m2 levert golfenergie veruit het meest op. Helaas is tot op heden deze vorm van energie nog steeds niet doorgebroken. Wanneer bouwkunde en duurzame energie elkaar op zee tegenkomen is dit het begin van een mooie samenwerking waarbij opwekking van golfenergie het platform biedt om een gebouw op te kunnen huisvesten. Deze samenwerking wordt in dit onderzoek getracht een extra duwtje in de goede richting te geven. Dit onderzoek is aanvankelijk opgestart als onderzoek naar “Overstromingsbestendige woningen” wat inhoudt het ontwerpen van een woning welke in staat is een overstroming te overleven zodat er geen (materiële) schade wordt geleden. Hierbij zou centraal staan dat de bewoner geen last van een overstroming zou hebben, de woning zou gewoon door kunnen functioneren. Ook zou in het onderzoek een soort brainstorm naar allerlei mogelijke principes, die het mogelijk maken een overstroming te kunnen weerstaan, worden vastgelegd welke mogelijk voor het definitieve ontwerp gebruikt zouden kunnen worden, of eventueel in een ander of volgend onderzoek van waarde zouden kunnen zijn. Delen van de voorstudie welke op deze woningen zijn geënt zijn gebruikt omdat deze een nauw verband hebben met het nieuw gekozen onderwerp. Dit onderzoek wordt als onderlegger gebruikt in de latere studie naar ontwikkelen van het ontwerpen van een “Sustainable Getijdenpaviljoen”. Gaandeweg het onderzoek wordt gekeken welke vormen van drijvende gebouwen er zijn. Zowel nieuwe als reeds beproefde concepten worden hierin meegenomen met als uitgangspunt, alles kan. Vervolgens wordt er gekeken welke type golfenergie extractie systemen er momenteel zijn. Hiervan is een selectie gemaakt op basis van de verschillende princiepen. Dezen zijn vervolgens opgesomd ,beschreven en op basis van een aantal selectie criteria is er 1 gekozen om toe te passen op het ontwerp. Voor het Paviljoen is een PVE opgesteld waaraan het ontwerp zal moeten voldoen. Zodoende is ook het kader van het ontwerp opgesteld. Aan de hand van dit PVE worden de energie systemen en de wijze waarop het paviljoen boven het zee niveau zal worden gehouden geselecteerd. Na deze selectie is het golfklimaat op de locatie, door het PVE voorgeschreven, in kaart gebracht. Aan de hand van deze gegevens is berekent wat de golfenergie ter plaatse bedraagt. Met deze wetenschap in het achterhoofd is begonnen aan het ontwikkelen van het Oscillating Water Column Platform oftewel OWCP. In verschillende fasen zijn constructie, werking van het opwekkingssysteem, vorm en afmetingen bepaald. Tevens is uitgezocht wat aannemelijk de te verwachte efficiëntie van het OWCP zal bedragen. Op basis hiervan is het mogelijk de opwekking van het systeem te bepalen. Tegen deze opwekking is ook het verwachte verbruik van de paviljoen functie afgezet en gekeken hoeveel procent daadwerkelijk door het platform zelf kan worden opgewekt. Dit geheel heeft geresulteerd in een mogelijk ontwerp met als basis het OWCP. Tot slot is er van het systeem een maquette gemaakt om werking van het systeem aan te tonen.","Sustainable; wave energy; renewable energy","nl","master thesis","","","","","","","","2011-08-12","Architecture","Building Technology","","Climate Design & Sustainability","",""

(mentor); Spandaw, J.G. (mentor); Roos, C. (mentor)","2010","In 1953 vond in Nederland de watersnoodramp plaats. Als gevolg daarvan werd de Deltacommissie ingesteld. Haar doel was om de overheid te adviseren welke maatregelen getroffen moesten worden zodat een tweede ramp voorkomen werd. De adviezen van de Deltacommissie hebben bijvoorbeeld geresulteerd in de afsluiting van de Nieuwe IJssel, de Oosterschelde, de Grevelingen en het Haringvliet. In Nederland zijn echter nog veel meer beschermingsmaatregelen. Er zijn 57 dijkringen. Een dijkring is een in de wet vastgelegd binnengebied dat voor water beschermd wordt door onder andere dijken, sluizen en gemalen. Ook de dijkringen zijn onderhavig aan verzakking en waterpeilstijging. Hierdoor is het belangrijk dat vaak onderzocht wordt of de dijken en de andere waterkeringen aangepast moeten worden. De verhoging van dijken staat centraal in dit verslag. Wanneer en hoeveel moet je een dijk ophogen zodat de kosten minimaal zijn. Om dit probleem op te lossen zijn verschillende formules nodig, zoals de kans op overstroming, verwachte schade bij overstroming en de investeringskosten voor het ophogen van de dijken. Aan de hand van deze formules kan het probleem gediscretiseerd worden tot een kortste pad probleem. Dit probleem wordt opgelost aan de hand van een algoritme dat in Matlab is geimplementeerd. In de minimale oplossing zijn de ophogingen nagenoeg periodiek. Dit is niet doordat de maximale toelaatbare overstromingskans wordt overschreden, maar doordat de verwachte schade, die als kostenpost wordt genomen, kleiner wordt als de kans op overstroming ook klein is. In de formules zijn verschillende waarden die afhangen van de economische situatie in het land. Dit zijn de rentevoet en de groei van de welvaart. Verschillende waarden hiervoor zijn ingevoerd in het model. Als de rente hoger wordt door hoge inflatie, worden de kosten van de ophogingen lager. Als de welvaart groeit, worden de kosten voor dijkophogingen hoger. Dit komt doordat bij overstroming meer verlies wordt geleden in een welvarender gebied. In New Orleans ging het in 2005 ook mis. Van deze ramp kan men ook in Nederland leren: New Orleans is vergelijkbaar met Nederland doordat het ook onder zeeniveau ligt en beschermd wordt door dijken. Uit deze ramp is gebleken dat men meer voorbereid moet zijn op een ramp en alle kosten van zo'n ramp ingecalculeerd moeten worden.","","nl","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Technische Wiskunde","","","",""

The relationship between an innovation which is already established in the market and a new budding innovation is not well known in every kind of market, especially when two innovative technologies are competing in different markets. This is the case of the PMP (Portable Media Player) and the smart phones market. For this thesis we are interested in the study of how earlier technological innovations are related to new technological innovations. Currently, there are already a lot of researches on specific innovations, but not on the relationship between these particular innovations. For this reason, it would be interested for practice and science to explore it, in order to extend the knowledge in this field. Therefore, analyzing the relationship between an old and already established technological innovation and a new technological innovation in the last phases of its diffusion process will be the objective of this thesis. In order to reach this objective, a pair of technologies has been chosen and will be analyzed. The old technology is the MP3 and the new technological innovation is the smart mobile phone. To reach the mentioned objective, the main research question that will be answered is: What is the relationship between market stabilization phase of an old technological innovation and market adaptation and stabilization phases of a new technological innovation (in different markets)? To answer the research question and other sub research questions, a review of the relevant literature was conducted. Thus, based on this literature, the main elements which may have an influence within the relationship between technologies were selected, consequently analyzed and then applied to our case analysis: MP3, iPod and iPhone. Then, the necessary data was collected in order to look for relationships between the two technological innovations. Gathered data was mainly based on: the internet, Apple annual reports, analysis reports and company press releases. The main result showed us that, some of the major elements which are related to the two technologies are kind of innovation, prices, organizational issues, product cycle life, market actors and strategies. Other important findings which were not expected are that other important aspects such as technological changes are also influencing the relationship between technologies in their specific phases. These changes within technologies let the new technology learn from the old one. Furthermore, limitations on this research were also found. This research has been carried out from the productive and development perspective. However, regarding the iPod and iPhone cases, platform perspective and its implications are an extensive approach which could be considered for further investigations. Among others, it is also important to mention the explorative and qualitative character of the research as limitations of this study. Although this research has its limitations, and has left many issues to investigate, this study has achieved its aim of examining the relationships between technological innovations. It also made a contribution for filling the gap in existing literature on the relation between patterns of diffusion within the innovation field.","innovation; diffusion model","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Technology, Policy and Management","Technology, strategy and Entrepreneurship","","Management of Technology","",""

(mentor)","2010","In modern day society concern is growing about the use of fossil fuels to meet our constantly rising energy demands, and the need for more sustainable energy is growing. Wind energy certainly has the potential to play a significant role in a sustainable future world energy supply and the wind power industry has grown to a globalized multi billion dollar industry. Manufacturers do not only compete with each other, but also with the traditional fossil energy sources. In order to come out on top, manufacturers are aiming at lowering the total turbine costs in order to lower the cost of renewable energy. An important way of achieving this is by reducing the total weight of turbine, by optimizing the design of each individual component. This causes a chain reaction of benefits as less material is used, transport and installation is made easier, a smaller foundation can be used and so on. On the downside, these optimized turbine designs generally introduce more flexibility to the structure. As a result, components start to exhibit local dynamic behavior, which can lead to increased component loading and decreased reliability. However, the aero-elastic models commonly used in wind turbine engineering are often incapable of predicting these local dynamic effects and their interaction with the global dynamics, due to their relatively few degrees of freedom and geometric simplifications. Therefore, a need exists for more detailed structural dynamic analysis tools, without losing generality and versatility. In this thesis the paradigm of dynamic substructuring is proposed to fill this need for detailed dynamic analysis tools in wind turbine engineering. Dynamic substructuring is a way to obtain the structural dynamic behavior of large and/or complex structures by dividing them into several smaller, simpler substructures (or components) of which the dynamic behavior is generally easier to determine. The dynamics of the total structure are then obtained by assembling the dynamic models of the components. A number of different techniques can be distinguished within the field of dynamic substructuring. In this thesis the emphasis is on the application and theory of Component Mode Synthesis techniques. The theoretical contributions are discussed first. Firstly, a general framework for substructure assembly is presented. In addition to the classic “primal” or “dual” assembly of interface displacements, this framework allows to assemble interface forces in a similar “primal” or “dual” manner. Furthermore, the framework enables the direct assembly of interface displacements and interface forces. The latter is called “mixed” assembly. In other words, direct assembly of stiffness matrices with flexibility matrices. Secondly, all common component model reduction techniques (Craig-Bampton, Rubin, etc.) and the relatively new Dual Craig-Bampton method are discussed. The Mixed Craig-Bampton method is introduced in this work and is a true generalization of the Craig-Bampton and Dual Craig-Bampton methods. It is shown that the accuracy of the Mixed Craig-Bampton methods is always in line with the Craig-Bampton and Dual Craig-Bampton methods, thereby emphasizing its versatility. Furthermore, a number of interface modeling strategies are discussed. Firstly, to enable assembly using only six degrees of freedom per interface, interface rigidification is discussed. A second option is to model the interface as fully flexible and retain all its degrees of freedom, which could result in incompatible substructure meshes. To overcome this issue several methods for assembly of non-conforming meshes are discussed. Finally, modeling of dynamic effects resulting from the interface itself (e.g. dynamic behavior of a bolt connection) is also presented in this thesis. Finally, interface reduction techniques are presented. Reduction of interface displacements is already well known from literature. On the other hand, reduction of interface forces, which is also presented in this work, has not been found in literature. It is shown that both methods are able to significantly reduce the number of degrees of freedom of the (reduced) substructure models. Using these methods and techniques, a dynamic substructuring analysis is performed using different reduced component models of the yaw system of a 2.3 Megawatt Siemens wind turbine. All the substructure components are modeled using the finite element method, but due to time limitations only one of the components is validated through measurements. By using the different component model reduction techniques, we were able to reduce the total number of degrees of freedom from almost 300.000 to approximately 750 for the entire yaw system, while maintaining an accurate model of the dynamic behavior for the frequency range of interest. From these results one can conclude that the dynamic substructuring approach shows great potential for use in wind turbine engineering. Even though some models are significantly simplified and not all the models used here are validated, it is clear that the techniques presented in this thesis allow for creating compact and accurate descriptions of the dynamic behavior of wind turbines. Nonetheless several challenges, with respect to non-linear models, controller models and others, are still to be met in order to generalize the methodology for application in wind turbine engineering.","model reduction; interface modeling","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2011-01-07","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Precision and Microsystems Engineering","","","",""

In dit project wordt gebruik gemaakt van Rüttel-Injectiepalen (RI-palen) als trek- en, in de eindsituatie, als drukpalen. De RI-paal, een Duitse funderingstechniek, heeft al ruim 15 jaar dienst bewezen in Duitsland. In Nederland is het echter de eerste toepassing van de RI-paal geweest. De belangrijkste redenen om dit paalsysteem toe te passen waren de geringe ontwikkeling van geluid- en trillingshinder in de constructiefase, het snel inbrengen in gronden met hoge conusweerstanden en een paal die zowel druk-, trekals horizontale krachten kan opnemen. Vooraf is door de opdrachtgever een proefbelasting uitgevoerd waarop het ontwerp is gebaseerd. Deze proef is op een alleenstaande paal uitgevoerd terwijl de uiteindelijke situatie betrekking heeft op een paalgroep. Tijdens de uitvoering heeft Van Hattum en Blankevoort opdracht gegeven aan Fugro om zes ingebrachte palen gedurende de volledige bouwtijd te monitoren. Tevens zijn er sonderingen tijdens alle bouwfasen uitgevoerd. Dankzij de vele gemeten gegevens biedt zich nu de mogelijkheid aan de krachtswerking van de paal nader te onderzoeken, inclusief een vergelijking van de geïnterpreteerde meetgegevens met verschillende ontwerpmethoden, waaronder de Nederlandse norm CUR2001-4. In het licht van het voorgaande heeft Volker Staal en Funderingen (VSF), een civiel aannemingsbedrijf, gespecialiseerd in zwaar en gecompliceerd funderingswerk, meetgegevens verzameld van de Rüttel-Injectiepaal. Een schat aan zeer waardevolle gegevens die, na interpretatie, kunnen zorgen voor beter inzicht in de toepassing van de RI-paal. Buiten dat het in Nederland de eerste toepassing is van dit type paal zijn de geïnstrumenteerde palen waardevol voor algemene trekpaaltheorieëen. Dit komt omdat normaliter trekpalen in de uitvoering weinig worden gemonitord wegens extra met zich meebrengende kosten. Normaal gesproken wordt alleen de verplaatsing van de onderwaterbetonvloer gemeten.","injectiepalen","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Geoscience & Engineering","","Geo-engineering","",""

Deze gebieden vragen om nieuwe ontwikkelingen waarbij de relatie met de bestaande stad van groot belang is. Het Vierhaven gebied in Rotterdam is zo’n gebied. Het Vierhavengebied is ontwikkeld tussen 1910 en 1915. Met de aanleg van de Tweede Maasvlakte, buiten de stad Rotterdam, verplaatst steeds meer haven industrie uit het Vierhavengebied naar deze nieuwe zone. Het Vierhaven gebied is uniek vanwege de ligging binnen de ring van Rotterdam, de afmetingen en de mogelijkheden wonen, werken en recreëren te combineren. Binnen deze ontwerpstudio is onderzoek gedaan naar de historie van de stad Rotterdam alsmede het Vierhaven gebied.

(mentor); Meijers, W.L.E.C. (mentor); De Wilde, T.S. (mentor); Rooij, R.M. (mentor)","2010","The link between railway station and city centre in the Netherlands is becoming increasingly important in our cities; On the one hand the railway station is gaining importance as entrance to the city (Rooij, 2005; Bertolini & Dijst, 2003; NS, 2006; NS Poort, 2009) and on the other hand cities are promoting their city centres to attract visitors and stimulate the local economy (Van der Hoeven et al., 2008). The link between station and centre therefore has to serve more and more people per day. This link is responsible for the arrival experience of visitors traveling by train to the city and therefore the place to make a good first impression (Van der Spek, 2006). However, the link between railway station and city centre is often unattractive and lacks vitality (Kusumo, 2007; Rooij & Read, 2008). Visitors of the city have to cross several barriers while walking to the city centre. Furthermore the route is often disorienting and the public space has a low quality. In other words, it is not an inviting entrance to the city: The link between railway station and city centre in the Netherlands is broken and needs to be fixed. This thesis aims at developing spatial design interventions to fix the link. The focus is on the unfamiliair visitor of a Dutch middle sized city traveling on foot from the central railway station to the city centre. The station is positioned outside of the historic city centre. The objective is to fix the link. The main research question of the thesis is: What spatial design interventions can create a strong, vital and attractive link between the Dutch central railway station and city centre? The spatial design interventions that can fix the link are found by: 1. A literature study on the work of leading authors in the field of (design of) successful public space in the 20th en 21st century. The study results in a list of criteria to fix the link; 2. A case study research on 16 comparable Dutch cases. For this research a validation tool is developed (based on the literature study) to objectively measure the quality of the links. 3. A design to fix the link in Haarlem. Haarlem is one of the 16 cases that has both a low score and a high potential. The main research question of the graduation project can be answered in four steps: 1. When dealing with a certain broken link between central railway station and city centre in the Netherlands, first of all the quality of this link should be validated with the help of the validation tool. In this way its strong and weak spots can be found. Furthermore the first recommendations for fixing the link can be made; 2. Then the railway station environment and link should be analysed on the scale of the city centre as a part of a network of activity nodes; 3. To fix the link both the railway station and link need to be integrated into the system of activity nodes of the city centre by adding nodes in the form of attractors and by changing the railway station environment itself into a place of stay and therefore an attractor as well. 4. Then the links themselves should be designed with the help of the criteria from the literature study. In other words, all links should be lively, have human scale, be legible and be safe & comfortable.","railway station environment; city centre; public space quality; pedestrian; spatial design intervention; the Netherlands; Haarlem","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Architecture","Urbanism","","","",""

The smart business network has emerged as a new organisational paradigm that promises more flexibility. A smart business network is a network of multiple actors that is supported by an open digital platform. Flexibility at the business level requires flexibility at the information technology level and alignment between the business level and the information technology level. The research described in the thesis focuses on the flexibility of the open digital platform at the information technology level. This open digital platform is the software system that supports the business processes of the actors of the smart business network. The objective is to design a flexible software system for a smart business network. The research is performed with an existing smart business network as the case study: the Internet Learning Community (IBLC). The thesis introduces an ontology-driven software architecture and a software engineering approach that is complementary to that architecture. The ontology-driven architecture is based upon the notion that the different actors in a smart business network may have different perceptions upon the business domain. An actor’s view upon the business domain is formalized in an ontology. The ontology consists of the terms and their relations used by the actor. The ontology is linked to the software components by models, which describe the individual components of the software system. The models and the source code of the components are defined using the same terms and relations as defined by the ontology.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Technology, Policy and Management","Information and Communication Technology","","","",""

Towards the end of the 20th century, many problems accumulated related to functioning of such large-scale urban blocks. To solve these issues and to fulfill the needs of the qualitatively new 21st-century society, a new concept of university campus has to be developed. Based on my research I created a strategy of enlivening the Roeterseiland campus by bringing in magnetisism of medieval city centers. I followed formal principles of their most attractive elements: of towers and squares. The straightforward strategy of this revitalizing design proposal solves the UvA campus’ spatial and functional problems on Roeterseiland. It brings the area closer to people by means of accessibility, functions and scale. A gate-like structure marks a new visible main entrance on the Sarphatistraat. Inside, a central square involves public functions. Uniformity of the square-walls is achieved by wrapping the existing buildings with a new narrow structure. Recessed from the street, a tower of 75 meters creates a new visible landmark at the edge of the inner city of Amsterdam. This new icon will contribute to visually connect the campus to its surroundings. The renovated diamond polishing factory will enhance the square, revealing the architectural and historical richness of Roeterseiland. This restructuring spatial design suggests a clear solution for widespread university campus’ problems, mainly resulting from planning mistakes in the 1960’s. It states that creating a human-scale urban core, by spatial principles of medieval city centers, would increase public use of the campus and integrate it into its urban context.","tower; square; roeterseiland; campus","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Architecture","Architecture","","Hybrid Buildings","",""

A core composed of precast elements differs from a cast in situ core in having connections between the precast elements. From preceding research (Falger, 2003) the stiffness reduction due to the horizontal joints and the open vertical joints can be estimated. There is however no literature available on the structural behaviour of precast corner connections. Since corner connections determine the degree in which the flange core walls are activated more research is required on the structural behaviour of precast corner connections. Therefore the focus of this thesis is on the influence of precast corner connections on the lateral deflections of a core.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Design and Construction","","","",""

A considerable amount of research has been dedicated to the importance of innovation , especially technical innovation. Design Engineering combines state of the art technology with an appealing skin, making it more desirable to own. The master of SPD combines Design Engineering and Marketing &Sales tools , to explore unknown fields of product development , to gain and exploit better knowledge tools and strategies that can lead to the same goal; better market performing products. A relatively unexplored subject, in this context ,is the role of aesthetics and in particular novelty of product aesthetics in NPD processes. How new should a product look and compared to what ? The following study is dedicated to answer this question from three different points of view. To that purpose a theoretical frame work was constructed ,using the available literature as a basis. It was found that the design newness of products could be measured by comparing a product to 1. Its predecessors, 2. Its brand members and 3. The competing products in the same category. A test case of cars from different brands , that were introduced to the market in a time span of nearly 30 years. Using visual stimuli , car experts rated each car on the three mentioned levels. The results indicate that the design newness of a car is many cases rated very differently , in different contexts and from different perspectives. Therefore design newness could not be seen as a static indication but rather as a dynamic variable that could be chosen according to firm market strategy. The results of this research could be generalised to predict new product performance, using the right design newness comparison as a tool.","design newness; aesthetics assement; automobile industry","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","2011-01-20","Industrial Design Engineering","Product Innovation Management","","Master of Science Strategic Product Design","",""

(mentor)","2010","Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) are ad-hoc wireless networks of small form-factor embedded nodes with limited memory, processing, and energy resources. Certain applications, like security and art monitoring,require reliable data transport. Current work for WSNs only provides stochastic reliability or guaranteed reliability for bulk transfer. This thesis describes the design, implementation, and evaluation of Reliable Transport AODV (RT-AODV). RT-AODV is a protocol that provides guaranteed reliability for individual messages. Both routing and reliable transport are covered in this work. End-to-end positive acknowledgements with timeouts and retransmissions are used to provide guaranteed reliability. NST-AODV, an existing any-to-any routing protocol, is used to route the data and acknowledgement messages through the network. To enhance the stability and quality of NST-AODV some adjustments are done: the hardware specifc Link Quality Indicator (LQI) is replaced by a statistical link estimator, and a loop detection mechanism and route quality monitoring are added. A proof of concept implementation has been done on the Embedded Software group's testbed. Experiments of larger scale and longer duration were done in TOSSIM simulations. For evaluation, Reliable Transport AODV (RT-AODV) is compared to the Collection Tree Protocol (CTP) and NST-AODV. Results show that RT-AODV performs well compared to both NST-AODV and CTP. A serious cost increase (in terms of transmissions) is involved with using end-to- end acknowledgements. The strength of RT-AODV is not pure delivery ratio. For larger networks, it performs slightly less than NST-AODV. However, RT-AODV guarantees that a message is delivered to its destination if an acknowledgement is received. The work described in this thesis shows that using end-to-end acknowledgements and any-to-any routing in wireless sensor networks is certainly viable.","Wireless Sensor Networks; reliable transport; acknowledgements; routing","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2010-02-10","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Computer Science, Embedded Software","","","",""

(mentor); Nadin, V. (mentor)","2010","The main objective of this project is to combat social exclusion in Greater Paris urban area, while the French government is keen on new strategies for transportation and densification to make a Greater Paris. This project turns its orientation to the social question. An important question that is either scarcely been put into consideration by planners or is faced in a naive way. The question for us planners is that how densification is possible with less deprivation and marginalization of the poor to happen, without inequality and injustice to take over? This project tries to find strategies to open the fragmented Metropolitan region of Paris to become a whole that can bring city life for all, to break the barriers to movement for chances of different people to co-appear in public, to walk freely in the (Greater) Parisian streets and to be seen. To bring spatial justice for all, by ‘politics of difference’ and ‘politics of presentation’. To combat segregation and social exclusion. While focusing and testing the strategies in the Northern Banlieues of Paris, the project addresses the problem with large scale intervention, to bring city life to the first ring of Paris, and connect people to the centre, once again break the walls for the sake of movement. But as the project argues the walls are not just a Peripherique Boulevard, the actual peripheral wall that disconnects people is a Metropolitan scale continuous set of barriers as thick as three times the city of Paris, housing millions inside. Regarding the regional scale problem, the project aims to open this multi layered closed Metropolis, providing access to urban space, to integrate space and prepare infrastructural ground for other resources to come and take part in city life: Jobs, services, cultural monuments. This city life is not a new model; it is already there in the 19th century fabric of Paris. Where access to resources such as jobs, shops, monuments, culture and health care is easy to achieve and is visible by walking and through multimodal public transport. This project is based on a presupposition that integration of all parts of the whole society to the principles of the French Republic is the ideal, even if this ideal could be seriously criticised as in practise there has been evidence of the opposite happening. The open city is a translation for this ideal, that there should be an infrastructural base ground for such a unified whole.","Paris; spatial justice; urban structure","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Architecture","Urbanism","","EMU","",""

Today, the capital of Greece is undergoing different transformations due to the shift from the industrial to the postindustrial and informational era. These observations could lead us to question the future of the city of Athens and of the Attica territory as a whole and could make us realize the potentialities of the drosscape within the Attica basin. Dross is the residual of the urban processes, the left-over, in other words the waste landscapes of the territory. The thesis attempts to confront the problem of wastelands, drosscape and brownfields and research for new tools to deal with them. The thesis is design-oriented and as a project attempts to transmit knowledge by integrating the different scales of city and territory. The main research question investigated is: «How can we re-use the waste landscapes of the Attica basin by combining the needs of both the metropolitan and the local scale? ». The analysis aimed at identifying the dross areas while looking at the factors contributing to their formation and trying to predict the future waste landscape within the specific territory of Athens.

(mentor); Zandbelt, D. (mentor); Nadin, V. (mentor)","2010","The in between city is often used to name areas which are neither urban nor rural, where “the sharp distinction between city and landscape has dissolved into an ecological and cultural continuum of a built structure between city and landscape”. Sieverts in (Huhlmann, 2007). The Thesis aims to gain a better understanding of how these territories function and how they perform according to social, economic and ecological planning goals, by developing an approach using the concept of ‘Permeability’, which I define as the property and capacity of the territory that facilitates connections and therefore flows. As a first step a classification on the regional scale to identify the ‘Territories in Between’ using two deliberately distinct and different case study areas (the province of South Holland in the Netherlands and the state of The Tyrol in Austria), is undertaken to later be able to draw conclusions which are valid in the European context. An integrated approach using the concept of permeability based on the understanding of these territories as both a place (a site or territory) and as a number of often just loosely bounded, relatively disconnected and dispersed, perhaps sprawling activities, made in and through many different kinds of networks, is used to gain a better understanding of the ‘Territories in Between’ in the two test case areas. Through the combination of economic, social and ecological as well as mapable permeability indicators, the territories can be investigated in a moderate relationalism which allows overcoming the ‘network versus territories’ as well as the ‘human versus nature’ divide. “On the one hand, networks should not be seen as non-spatial and without ‘geographical anchors’ and on the other hand, territories and scales should not be viewed as closed and static.” (Jones, 2009) Following this idea the indicators are chosen according to their suitability to establish a relationship between the territory and the flows within the landscape, describing the traces of these flows. Finally general planning and design principles are developed, which are based on a relational and not functional understanding of the ‘Territories in Between’, by comparing the indicators and the results within the different case study areas.","urban rural relations; territories in-between; regional planning; permeability","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Architecture","Urbanism","","European Postgraduate Masters in Urbanism","",""

(mentor); Kuipers, H. (mentor)","2010","The main function of the schoolbag today is, transporting study materials. The aesthetics of the bag however, influences the buying behavior of the consumer the most. Current disadvantages of schoolbags are bad ergonomics and low interaction between product and user. In the saturated schoolbag market the main focusses are on better ergonomics and fashionable aesthetics. The future context of 2020, shows a shift in importance of these three aspects. Consumers and their demands change. Trends like tailored designs, self-identity, social interaction and participation in production rise the demands for aesthetics, but even more for interaction. An alternation in the educational system influences the schoolbag. New digitalized study materials reduce the weight of the bag, reducing also the need for ergonomics. A concept design for 2020, called ‘The paper bag’, enables unlimited possibilities for customizing the appearance of the bag. The exterior of the bag is one big, e-paper, display with a touchscreen layer. The interaction is improved by integration of multiple functions, which give the bag more utility and by a two way communication between the product and its user. The exterior functions, amongst others, as a laptop. The appearance of the exterior can be customized like wallpapers on a computer. Wireless connectivity assures social interaction and can be synchronized with other devices like for instance the mobile phone. ‘The paper bag’ uses new techniques and materials which are not yet fully developed or in production. The functioning of the bag will be changed by social and political trends. Therefore it is recommended to keep track of some necessary changes like developments in display techniques, battery efficiency, social media and digitalization of the school system. Introduction of a bag for Thella in 2012, means simplifying and adjusting ‘The paper bag’ to the needs and possibilities of 2012. This bag, called the crocque-au-tile, should match the same goals as ‘The paper bag’; more customizability and better interaction. The crocque-au-tile is a shoulder bag that enables customizing by the use of printable magnets. The owner can express their own identity by text, graphics or pictures. The crocque-au-tile has some features for a specified target group, the fashionista’s; an insulated food compartment and an extra pocket for make-up equipment. Interactive magnets can be made to create more interaction like mirror magnets or phone light magnets. User research shows appreciation for the way of customizing, the food compartment and the interactive magnets. The intended use of the laptop compartment, working instantly on the laptop by just opening the compartment, is also appreciated. The specified target group uses lockers and therefore the shoulder bag can fit the fashionista’s lifestyle. Problems occur however with the appearance. The dislike of the pattern needs more research before it can be solved. Color issues can be solved by providing the bag in several color-combinations. The bag can be introduced to the market if these problems are solved. The financial evaluation shows just a small revenue per bag. Thella has no experience in producing bags and has no clientèle or image yet. This makes it a very high risk to enter a saturated market, especially for only small margins. A partnership with an experienced, high end, fashion brand, like Bjorn Borg or Converse, would be the best way to get this bag on the market.","school bag; e-paper; magnet; customizing; Thella; laptop; digital; education","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Design Engineering","","","",""

Knowledge about the blood flow velocities and profiles in patient’s aneurysms is of major importance to understand their effect on the blood vessels. The Amsterdam Medical Center obtains blood flow velocities and profiles in the aneurysm region with a measurement technique called phase contrast MRI. There is a need for a validation of the measurement technique and protocol of the Amsterdam Medical Center. A common way of validation is the use of a flow phantom which is, in this case, a physical model of the circulation in the region of an aneurysm. In this project, the flow velocities and profiles in the aneurysm phantom are measured with phase contrast MRI and with Particle Image Velocimetry. The results of both measurement techniques are compared in order to contribute to the validation of blood flow measurements in intracranial aneurysms with phase contrast MRI.","aneurysm; phantom; flow; PC-MRI; PIV","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2011-06-15","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","BioMechanical Engineering","","","",""

In healthcare, human beings are in the center of attention. When considering the domain of ICT, computing and connectivity first come to mind. It is suggested that the first step in bridging the gap between the two domains is to focus on the essence of care processes, independent of their realization and implementation. In other words, independent of any technology that is required to make them operational. As part of this essence, communication and (social) commitment turn out to be indispensable. Both subjects are currently insufficiently paid attention to, as this thesis will reveal. In this report, three applications of the Dutch national Electronic Health Record are analyzed and redesigned from an Enterprise Ontology viewpoint. Enterprise Ontology is an emerging field in the information sciences and engineering disciplines that has its roots in communication philosophy. It provides the required theory and a matching methodology to pursue this goal of bridging the healthcare and ICT domains. Instead of adjusting ‘the business’ to each individual application of the Electronic Health Record, a single shared perspective on care processes is provided. It demonstrates that the activities of the various care professionals at their core generally do not differ. Furthermore, it secures the consistency and coherence of the application designs, while presenting all important and sensible aspects in a concise way. This approach is thought to be the only correct starting point to determine, design and implement supporting information systems for the healthcare sector or any enterprise in general.","Enterprise Ontology; DEMO; healthcare; health care; Nictiz; ICT; Electronic Health Record; EHR","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Information Systems Design Group","","","",""

Many issues arise in the implementation of such a system, which is often modeled as the Dynamic Dial-a-Ride System with Time Windows (DDARPTW). One of those issues is that taxi companies try to maximize their profit by combining as many rides as possible. This leads to longer travel times, a measure that is expressed in the service quality of a ride. Our main contribution is a system in which multiple companies compete on service quality to increase the average service quality of the rides. We use an auction mechanism to assign rides to companies and an on-line optimization technique to insert assigned rides into current schedules. To determine an offer for announced requests, we allow companies to use knowledge about the distribution of future requests by the use of a Monte Carlo simulation.","dial-a-ride systems; insertion heuristic; Mixed Integer Programming; transportation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Software Technology","","","",""

(mentor); Serdijn, W.A. (mentor)","2010","An action potential or spike detector is an important part of neural recording implants. The detector performs on-chip data reduction by trying to capture only relevant information (real occurrences of the action potential) from the recorded signals. This data selection is indispensable since it helps reducing data rate as well as operating power for wireless data transmission of the neural sensor. This thesis explores the possibility of improving detections and reducing power consumption of neural spike detectors. As a result, two designs are presented in this thesis. First, the dynamic translinear realization of the nonlinear second-order differential equation describing the nonlinear energy operator performing the real time energy detection of analog signals is presented. The spikes are isolated from the background noise as the energy of the spikes is considered to be different from the background noise. The quiescent power consumption equals 7.2 mW. The expected behavior of the designed nonlinear energy operator is demonstrated by means of simulations. In addition, an ultra low-power CMOS analog circuit for detection of APs embedded in noisy signals is presented. The proposed strategy isolates APs by detecting subsequently a positive and a negative spike of each AP. An AP is detected only if the positive spike is detected within a short period of time after the negative spike was detected. The final circuit operates from a 1-V supply and consumes only 1.5 nA. The detector is verified by means of simulations with synthetic neural waveforms and is able to successfully detect APs in noisy signals. In addition, the 1.5 nW power dissipation is by far the smallest among action potential detectors reported in the literature.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2011-01-13","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Microelectronics & Computer Engineering","","","",""

Subsequently a Pseudo Rigid Body method was used for a type synthesis and rough dimensional analysis in order to determine the topology of the conceptual design. In order to evaluate the grasping behavior of the conceptual design, four mock-ups were created. Detailed dimensioning design was performed by semi automatic numerical analysis using a finite element method in which the conceptual design was used as an initial input. A prototype based on this final design was manufactured and experimentally evaluated. It was found that utilizing the concepts of under actuation and compliance solved the identified problems within conventional prosthetic fingers. As a result of the design process and the use of a predefined structure a fully compliant underactuated finger with a monolithic structure and distributed compliance was obtained.

(mentor); Riviere, P. (mentor); Schifferstein, H.N.J. (mentor)","2010","Sponsored by the Consumer Science department in Groupe Danone France, this design project is aiming to use a Multisensory Design (MSD) approach in developing a new packaging for the ‘Replenishment’ platform in Danone water division. The main design goal is to create a particular drinking experience that could better communicate the most relevant effect of Replenishment to consumers. The project follows a special and logic approach: it starts from understanding the meaning of Replenishment that Optimism is selected as the appropriate experience to communicate Replenishment. The second phase is the sensory exploration to define the particular expression of Optimism. Through intuitively sensing the material world, the designer defines three sensory expressions based on the different physical work of the sensory stimuli. The expression ‘off the track’ is selected concerning the brand image, design goal and consumer’s expectation. The concept, a packaging for bottled water, is developed based on the knowledge from the 1st and 2nd phase that it communicates the expression ‘off the track’ under a specific interaction in all senses. The designed experience is stronger than the product developed under other design approaches that it stimulates the senses of vision, touch, sound and smell. For the users, the new concept can change the traditional drinking experience into fun and brings inspirations in the simple everyday life, and it encourages people to explore and be creative that help them to become open-minded and appealing to other people around. For the target brand, the new concept can help it to enhance the brand identity and to differentiate its brand from other competitors. For the company Groupe Danone, the new concept brings it fresh and interesting things that can support it in the future development.","multisensory design; drinking; replenishment; optimism; bottled water","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","2011-01-11","Industrial Design Engineering","Industrial Design","","Master of Science Strategic Product Design","",""

(mentor); Boersema, T. (mentor)","2010","Today, the Dutch Railways (NS) is forced to extend their capacity, because of the increase in train passengers. This extension will be realised by using longer and faster trains, soon also scheduled highly frequent. But these solutions are expensive, and in addition they cannot be extended much further to provide the necessary capacity. The NS passenger however, prefers a free seat and not feeling crowded. Another approach to increase the chance of a free seat and reduce the feeling of crowdedness for the passenger, in addition to longer/faster/highly frequent trains, is to influence the current unequal spreading of boarding passengers to make more efficient use of the available train capacity. This report investigated the possible means to change the boarding behavior of passengers to give them a more comfortable train journey. Unequal spread on the platform was determined as a type of spread that should be improved: The other types of unequal spread, during the day and in certain directions, are related to external social factors (work, private life) are therefore difficult to change within the perspective of a design project. The unequal spread on the platform is caused by passengers that stay close to the platform entrances. Since most of these passengers board at that location, and do not like to walk through the train, they also cause local crowdedness inside the train. A qualitative research has been done to research the reasons for this platform behavior and to test envisioned possibilities to change this behavior (visualising crowdedness or train length with an information system). This qualitative research showed that this visualising crowdedness did not have the expected outcome of a better passengers’ spread. Passengers want a free seat, but more factors than just crowdedness (number of alighting passengers, behavior of other passengers on the platform, how fast you can get into the train) play a role to obtain this. Information on just crowdedness therefore does not motivate passengers to spread. The results led to the design of the Platform Positioner. The Platform Positioner information service can provide passengers with five types of personal boarding advice on where to board:  for an efficient transfer/follow up journey,  first class,  the silent zone,  with a bike  with a wheelchair. The advice are generated using three data sources: Real-time train length information provided by the NS Tracking and Tracing system, the platform layouts of train stations from a database, and information on train layout provided by a functionality within NS On Board Information System (OBIS). The last two sources do not currently exists as such. This boarding advice on the ideal platform position differ per passenger, and so passengers board at different carriages of the train. This will create a better spread on both the platform and inside the train, while anticipating on the user’s motivation to have a more efficient and comfortable journey. The Platform Positioner is provided to passengers by NS mobile travel information; directly available with a mobile phone. Or NS Service personnel could inform travellers, since the information is available on their NS PDA. The Platform Positioner was evaluated in two usage test on usability, understandability and appreciation to improve the design. The results were good: Passengers can use and understand the Platform Positioner information service easily, they appreciate the advice and are motivated by to move across the platform. Certain aspects were not fully examined in this project and need to be further investigated in order to create the actual Platform Positioner. A feasibility study on the following aspects is therefore recommended, possibly followed by a test with a working prototype.  The improvement or disadvantages on the spread of a bigger crowd needs to be investigated.  The possibilities of data links between Tracking and Tracing, OBIS and NS mobile travel information, need to be investigated in more detail.","NS; train travelling; passenger spread; platform behavior; boarding advice; mobile travel information","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Human Information and Communication Design","","","",""

The project site is located in the buffer space between the two districts, Almere buiten and Almere stad in Almere The Nederlands. This city has six districts, Almere stad, Almere buiten, Almere haven, Almere poort, Almere buiten, and Almere Pampus. This what we called polynuclear city the first in the Netherlands. Almere is the youngest city in Netherlands ; characterized by low and medium rise building in a sub urban life style. Almere characterized also by modern architecture. When you are visiting Almere, you will be constantly surprised by creations of many top architects from both home and abroad. From Rem Koolhaas until Portzamparc. Everything is possible in Almere. Perhaps, we can call Almere the first architecture laboratory in The Netherlands. This project has five dwelling towers. Deck connects all five dwelling towers each other. Extra functions such as library, children playground and café restaurant will be located on this deck. Four key words describe the concept of this project, contrast, connecting, border and sustainable and bioclimatic design. The first three keywords are the function of buffer space in a polynuclear city which is concluded from the previous research. Another aspect that also is important to consider is energy efficient architecture. Energy efficient architecture seeks a balance between energy conservation and energy gain. From planning perspective, the greatest influences are on building proportion and orientation. The sun path, the qualitative difference between the morning and evening sun and sun altitude should be taken into consideration in the allocation of the floor plan.","Almere polynyuclear city buffer space","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2010-01-15","Architecture","Architecture","","master living environment Dwelling","",""

(mentor); Van Lint, J.W.C. (mentor); De Vries, R. (mentor); Kusters, M.M. (mentor); Stelling, G.S. (mentor); Wiggenraad, P.B.L. (mentor)","2010","Road users have never had as much travel information as is available today. However the extent of congestion on major roads has also never been as critical as it is now. For this reason road authorities, including Rijkswaterstaat1, aim to inform road users as best they can in an effort to allow the road user to make a more educated decision on travel and to increase the confidence they have in travel times. In a bid to improve traffic flow on motorways, many roadworks are carried out yearly with a large number planned for the coming years. This contributes to congestion and delays in the short term however and leads to a greater uncertainty in travel times. Many techniques and models already exist to predict travel times under ‘irregular’ traffic conditions. For situations where roadworks are due to be carried out in the future however, no models or methods explicitly exist which allow travel times to be predicted in advance. It is this problem that this research project attempts to tackle. The main objective for this research is to develop a methodology incorporated in a model, which is capable of predicting travel times on motorway corridors for situations during roadworks that are to be carried out in the future. To achieve this objective the research question is posed: How can a-priori travel times be predicted on motorway corridors for situations during roadworks, prior to the commencement of the roadworks? The objective is achieved by firstly consulting external research on the topics of travel time estimation with models and the influence of roadworks on travel times. Using the acquired knowledge a modelling approach is developed which makes use of the basic principles of traffic flow based on the conservation of vehicles and first order traffic flow theory. The developed model makes use of traffic flow profiles and capacity profiles, which are processed by an LWR-model using a Godunov scheme. Traffic is numerically fed through the model and where it exceeds capacity, congestion occurs and propagates backwards in space according to first order traffic flow theory and in keeping with the general characteristics of real traffic flow. From the modelled data, speeds are derived for each iterated section. This allows for travel times per section and total travel times along a certain trajectory starting at a specific time of day to be calculated. These travel times form the prediction for the corresponding motorway corridor. The effects of roadworks are incorporated in the model through a reduction of the road capacity in the capacity profile. This is performed by applying a capacity reduction factor to the available capacity. This reduction factor is determined using characteristics of the roadworks which correspond to certain reduction values taken from extensive research preformed externally. The traffic flow profile is also adjusted for the effects of mobility management, which is commonly applied during roadworks in the Netherlands. Mobility management is an organised attempt to reduce the level of traffic demand on routes where road capacity is not expected to be able to cope with traffic demand, such as during roadworks. A mobility management factor is therefore applied to the traffic demand profile to reduce demand as a consequence of this. The model is evaluated using a roadworks study case on the A12 between The Hague and Gouda. The results of the model, in which a base capacity2 of 2100 veh/hr/ln is applied, show a good likeness to the recorded travel times during the performed roadworks. An absolute relative error of less than 5% is recorded for the travel times during the main peak periods. These results are produced with the application of a mobility management factor of 6-7%, which corresponds to the expected values for this specific case. The performance requirement for the error of travel times during the entire day is also achieved in the case study. The research shows that predicting travel times for future roadworks is possible and moreover can be performed in a relatively accurate fashion without the necessity of an overcomplicated model. Producing traffic flow demands is achievable, however estimating the extent of mobility management and the indirect reduction of traffic demand is more complicated. Road capacity during roadworks is affected and estimates are made of the reduced workzone capacity. The capacities found show a good likeness to recorded data, however small adjustments in the capacity reduction have the potential for large travel times variations. For this reason the application of confidence bandwidths, as applied, is valuable. Further difficulties in determining capacities stem from the inability to produce operational capacity estimations where no congestion occurs. The application of a base capacity solves this, however the applied value cannot be generically validated with great ease. The application of the model is most suited to implementation for road user information through a website or incorporated in a route planner. The use of the model in roadwork planning is also possible, but will require alterations to model. The case study results are encouraging, however the model requires further validation over a wider range of roadworks as varying locations and roadwork characteristics may lead to differing results. Further research is recommended into a simple capacity reduction method for roadworks. Research on the effect of mobility management and an effective method to estimate the effect of it is also recommended. The implementation of these as well a generic manner of determining a base capacity in the model are further recommended as possible adjustments to improve the model.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Transport & Planning","","","",""

(mentor); Heemink, A.W. (mentor)","2010","In the early 90’ the research institute Deltares began the development of a non-hydrostatic extension for the existing three-dimensional shallow-water simulation software Delft3D-FLOW a modeling package which was originally intended for hydrostatic shallow-water flow. The original non-hydrostatic flow model is based on a non-conservative finite-difference discretization of the momentum equations. A model study demonstrated improved performance of conservative discretization schemes over non-conservative scheme for strongly varying and convection-dominated flow. For non-hydrostatic flow a momentum conservative finite-volume discretization is more appropriate. A three-dimensional finite-volume scheme on staggered z-layer grids is presented with improved momentum conservation properties. For simulations of dynamic flow the conservation properties in time of the numerical scheme become more important. Since many typical non-hydrostatic flow situations do not concern steady state calculations, also attention is paid to the momentum conservation properties of the model in time. For strongly non-hydrostatic flow simulations the treatment of the bottom and free-surface becomes of large importance. The design of the finite-volume discretization gave the opportunity to have a renewed look on of the existing Delft3D z-layer model. Simulations have been carried out of short waves in a basin. The results showed an improvement compared with the existing finite-difference method and brought to the attention other aspects of the existing discretization that demand improvement in order to make the model suitable for strongly non-hydrostatic, convection-dominated flow.","cfd; convection; finite volume","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Applied Mathematics","","Mathematical Physics","",""
