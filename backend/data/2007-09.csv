Data analysis shows that the scour hole developed in a former complex estuarine system. The analysis strongly suggests that erosion occurred through a number of different old (clay) layers. The presence of cohesive layers can reduce the development of the scour hole considerably. Implementation of cohesive layers in the Delft3d model showed that the erosion rate as observed in reality can be simulated with cohesive sediment. Armouring of the bed, erosion of fine sediments and the harder to erode coarser sediment remains, also result in a reduction of the scour hole. The armouring effect can be simulated in a schematized way by distinguishing a number of fractions and bed layers. Simulations show that armouring indeed reduces the development of the depth of the scour hole. However, the computed erosion is still considerably higher compared to the observed erosion rate. Computations for the Maasvlakte 2 indicate that the main flow characteristics are similar. It is expected that the development of the scour shows much resemblance. Therefore similar parameters can be used for the Maasvlakte 2 situation. The above mentioned mechanisms result in a lower erosion rate for the Maasvlakte 2 situation. The cohesive layers are positioned deeper and therefore the armouring effect is also of importance. The development of the scour hole strongly depends on the bed composition while this composition is vaguely known because of inhomogeneity of the bed. Therefore the predictions of the Maasvlakte 2 are expected to be less accurate.","scour hole; Maasvlakte; armouring; claylayer; delft3d","en","master thesis","TU Delft, Civil Engineering and Geosciences, Hydraulic Engineering","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","","","","",""

Vanwege de impact van de hoogbouw op zijn omgeving, verlangen steeds meer gemeenten een Hoogbouw Effectrapportage (HER) bij de aanvraag van de bouwvergunning van een dergelijk project. In de HER zijn de effecten van het hoogbouwproject op zijn omgeving omschreven, maar de gewenste inhoud van de HER verschilt sterk per gemeente. Dit is ontstaan doordat de invulling van het beleid ten aanzien van hoogbouw door de landelijke overheid wordt overgelaten aan de locale overheden. Het heeft geleid tot verschil in aanpak door de locale overheden onderling en wisselende resultaten. Voor de betrokken partijen, met name de initiatiefnemer, is die verschillende aanpak per gemeente verwarrend. Daar komt bij dat de door de locale overheden uitgegeven documentatie van haar hoogbouwbeleid meestal niet duidelijk aangeeft wat de verlangde gegevens in de HER zijn en wat haar beoordelingswijze over de verstrekte informatie is. De enkele gemeenten die wel aangeven wat zij in de HER verlangen, hebben vrijwel allemaal een eenzijdige set criteria gepresenteerd, waardoor andere belangrijke aspecten in de Effectrapportage onderbelicht zijn. Ter bevordering van de transparantie van de HER beoordelingsmethodiek en het harmoniseren van de HER in Nederland, heeft dit afstudeerwerk tot doel: Het ontwerpen van een landelijke onderlegger van de Hoogbouw Effectrapportage (HER). Hiertoe is eerst een onderzoek gedaan naar de huidige stand van zaken in Nederland (meetpunt februari 2006) omtrent het beleid ten aanzien van hoogbouw. De inventarisatie van het hoogbouwbeleid van de 25 grootste gemeenten in Nederland maakt de verschillen in aanpak per gemeente duidelijk. Bovendien worden verschillende functies aan de hoogbouw toegeschreven. Naast de functies huisvesting, verdichting en functiemenging, kan met het hoogbouwproject ook een verbetering van de stadstructuur, identiteit en de stedelijkheid worden bewerkstelligd. Voor de opzet van de HER wordt er van uit gegaan dat de locale overheid haar beleid/visie ten aanzien van hoogbouw in een document (bijvoorbeeld hoogbouwvisie), anders dan de HER, publiekelijk maakt. De vereiste inhoud, aanpak en beoordeling van de HER wordt ondergebracht in de hoogbouwtoets en is aanvullend op bijvoorbeeld de hoogbouwvisie.","","nl","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Design and Construction","","","",""

(mentor); Spanhoff, R. (mentor); Stive, M.J.F. (mentor); De Boer, G.J. (mentor)","2007","Holland is a densely populated country with an important coastal zone that comprises most of the Dutch population. The dunes, the beach and the shoreface are a natural sandy protection for the Dutch coast. Natural processes, such as waves, winds and tides, coupled with human activity, may lead to shoreline erosion. Gradual recession of the coast can become a threat for the safety of the polders and consequently for the people that live behind the dikes and their properties. In The Netherlands the most sufficient method to counteract erosion is the application of nourishments. During the application of a shoreface nourishment, the sand is not placed on the beach or the dunes, but under water on the shoreface. In this study the effects of three shoreface nourishments applied on the areas of Ter Heijde, Katwijk and Noordwijk are studied and analyzed. To increase the insight into the effects of a shoreface nourishment to the natural system a number of research questions are introduced. How is the autonomous behaviour of the cross-shore profiles volume changing? How is the landward part of the profile affected? Does the shoreface nourishment result in beach widening? What is the behaviour of the longshore sediment transport? Does the nourishment result in downdrift erosion and updrift sedimentation? Onshore versus offshore sediment transport. Aim of this study is to find answers to the above mentioned research questions. A first analysis step is to study the volume evolution in each of the cross-shore profiles of the three study areas. The study is based on a transect by transect analysis. The total volume is divided in three horizontal subsections that represent the dune, the beach and the shoreface volume. To investigate the immediate effects that a shoreface nourishment has on the shoreface profiles, the shoreface profile volume is divided in sub sections. Two periods are introduced, the pre nourishment period and the post nourishment period. The volume changes during the pre nourishment and post nourishment period are compared. Finally, to investigate whether or not the shoreface nourishment results in beach widening, the concept of the beach width indicator (BWI) is developed, which is based on volumes per unit length. The nourishment volume, in the cases of Katwijk and Noordwijk, was placed outside the yearly measuring range. Thus, the main research question of the present study; how is the autonomous behaviour of the cross-shore profiles volume changing? cannot be answered. Below, the final conclusions are briefly mentioned. From the total volume analysis it can be concluded that in the area of Ter Heijde the shoreface nourishment did not affect the autonomous behaviour of the cross-shore profile of the transects located in the nourishment area. For Katwijk and Noordwijk it was observed a quick response of the nourishment. From the dune and beach volume analysis, it can be concluded that the nourishment resulted in the increment of the dune volume in the areas of Katwijk and Noordwijk. The beach volume was slightly increased in the area of Noordwijk. From the beach width indicator approach concluded that the shoreface nourishment in general, did not result in beach widening. From the longshore sediment transport analysis it can be concluded that only for the case of Ter Heijde the outgoing longshore sediment transport has been decreased. It is possible that the opposite effect of the salient effect occurred. For the cases of Katwijk and Noordwijk it is not possible to come up with conclusions.","nourishment; shoreface; cross-shore; longshore","en","master thesis","TU Delft, Civil Engineering and Geosciences, Hydraulic Engineering","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","","","","",""

(mentor)","2007","The least-squares spectral element method (LSSEM) is a relatively new state of the art numerical method which is capable of solving complex problems with high accuracy. Very promising results for hyperbolic equations using a spacetime formulation have recently been obtained. In this report steady state solutions for 2D hyperbolic systems of equations are investigated. Especially, the solutions which contain discontinuities are a point of interest. The shallow water equations (SWE) and Euler equations are used for this purpose. By defining test cases for which the exact solutions are known the accuracy of the LSSEM is determined and more importantly it was observed that the shock position found by the LSSEM matched the analytical shock positions. However, this was only the case when conserved quantities were used. The use of primitive variables does not lead to correct shock positions. The results for the 2D channel flow with a circular bump are in agreement with known results for all (subsonic, transonic and supersonic) cases. However, applying and weighing the slip flow boundary condition is tricky and will influence the solution. Nonetheless, the LSSEM is capable of finding solutions for this type of problems which are in agreement with other numerical methods.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","","","","",""

Observed water level set-up and set-down indicate the locations of feeder currents, driving the rip current. Wave-current interaction between the incoming bi-chromatic waves and the outgoing rip-current are apparent in the measurements. The stochastic character of meandering of the rip current is shown by the variance of the low pass filtered time-averaged local velocities. The vertical velocity distribution could not be determined reliably due to limitations in the test set-up and measurement devices. The dispersion relationship is utilized to connect the PTV surface measurement with the underlying velocity field obtained by in-situ measurements.

(mentor)","2007","Multi-fluid flows are found in many applications in engineering and physics. Examples of these flows from engineering are water-air flows in ship hydrodynamics, exhaust-air flows behind rockets, gas-petrolea flows in upstream pipes of oilrigs, air-fuel bubble interaction flows in scramjets and many others. To gain better insight in the behavior of multi-fluid flows, especially two-fluid flows, numerical simulations are needed. We assume that the fluids do not mix or chemically react, but remain separated by a sharp interface. With these assumptions a model is developed for unsteady, compressible two-fluid flow, with pressures and velocities that are equal on both sides of the interface. The model describes the behavior of a numerical mixture of the two-fluids (not a physical mixture). This kind of interface modeling is called interface capturing. Numerically, the interface becomes a transition layer between both fluids. The model consists of five equations; mass, momentum and energy equation for the mixture (these are the standard Euler equations), mass equation for one of the two fluids and energy equation for one of the two fluids. This last equation is not conservative, but contains a source term. The source term represents the exchange of energy between the two fluids. The model is discretized by using a finite-volume approximation. The finite-volume method consists of a third-order Runge-Kutta scheme for temporal discretization and a limited second-order spatial discretization. For the flux evaluation Osher’s Riemann solver is constructed, which uses a new set of Riemann invariants that was derived for the two-fluid model. The source term is evaluated using the limited state distribution and the wave pattern in the Osher solver. The two-fluid model is validated on several shock tube problems. The results show that the method is pressure-oscillation-free without special precautions, which is not the case for most other two-fluid flow models. The developed method is applied to two shock-bubble interaction problems. The numerical results really show the competence of the two-fluid model.","shock-bubble interaction; Unsteady compressible two-fluid flow; interface capturing; source term; energy exchange; Osher’s Riemann solver; finite-volume discretization; shock tube problem","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","","","","",""

(mentor)","2007","MSc Project Hydraulic Engineering - Delft University of Technology, Faculty of Civil Engineering and Geosciences, Section Hydraulic Engineering and Universidade do Vale do Itajaí, Centro de Ciências Tecnológicas da Terra e do Mar. - The town of Ingleses on Santa Catarina Island, in the state of Santa Catarina, Brazil, is threatened by nature at two different fronts. At the northern side of the town lies Ingleses Beach which appears to be subject to ongoing erosion. This forms a threat to the houses near the shore and diminishes the recreational value of the area. On the southern side, the town is threatened by a migrating dunefield, which is encroaching onto the houses and infrastructure. According to locals, dozens of houses have already been buried under the sand. The aim of this report is to give full insight in the situation and to find a number of possible solutions to the problems. There are, in fact, two dunefields in the area around Ingleses. The second dunefield does not pose a direct threat to the town, but passes the town on its eastern side. This dunefield is nevertheless very important, as it supplies a significant amount of sediment to Ingleses Beach. Research has been done to investigate how both dunefields migrate. An important result of this research is that the first dunefield (that is overwhelming the houses on the south side of the town) has never reached all the way to the beach. It had been previously assumed that the erosion of the beach was, wholly or partially, caused by the fact that sediment from the first dunefield could no longer reach the beach due to the urbanization between the dunefield and the beach. This assumption however has proven to be false. Another important result is the determination of the sediment influx rate from the second dunefield into the breaker zone of Ingleses Beach. This is an important factor in modelling the evolution of the beach. To be able to make predictions about the evolution of Ingleses Beach it is necessary to have nearshore wave data. Such data is not readily available and must, therefore, be obtained in another way. The available data consists of one year worth of measured wave data at a location about 35 kilometres offshore of Santa Catarina Island. To be able to translate this wave data to the nearshore of Ingleses Beach a thorough investigation of the bathymetry between the point where the wave data was measured and the beach has been carried out with the aid of the software package ArcGIS. With this bathymetry the available wave data can be translated to the nearshore of Ingleses Beach using the wave modelling program SWAN. The evolution of the beach has been modelled for two different scenarios using the computer program UNIBEST CL+. The first scenario represents a continuation of the present day situation. Simulation of this scenario has resulted in a trend prediction for the evolution of the beach. This prediction shows that, if no countermeasures are taken, some areas along the beach are indeed subject to erosion and houses in those areas will be severely threatened by the water. The second scenario represents a situation where the influx of sediment from the easterly dunefield is cut off from the sea. This may be due to ongoing urbanization between the dunefield and the sea, or fixation of the dunes by vegetation. If such a situation should occur the simulation shows that the erosion to be expected will be considerably more severe than in the first scenario. More houses will be threatened and a highly undesirable situation for people living near the shoreline, as well as economical damage due to loss of recreational areas, is the result. From the results of the dune study and the beach model simulation it is clear that action needs to be taken at both fronts. Several possible solutions to the problems have been produced based on the qualitative, and if possible quantitative, results of the research. It has been concluded that an extensive monitoring program and continued research are needed in order to quantify most of the suggested solutions. The monitoring can be done parallel to the excavation of the dunefield, which will give immediate results. While calculations and research are done on a suitable nourishment program, the sand of the Moçambique dunefield can be used for a small-scale nourishment. This will give extensive information about the way this sediment input will influence the morphology of Ingleses beach.","","en","student report","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","","",""
