(mentor); Meijers, R. (mentor); Baars, E.T. (mentor); Rietveld, L. (mentor); Babuska, R. (mentor); De Koning, J. (mentor)","2002","Weesperkarspel produceert jaarlijks zo’n 28 miljoen m3 drinkwater. Een van de zuiveringstappen is de ozonisatie waar het water door bellenkolommen met ozonhoudend gas stroomt. Sinds januari 2001 eist de Waterleidingwet dat een persoon een maximaal risico van 10-4 per jaar mag lopen op een infectie via drinkwater. Uit deze eis zijn maximale concentraties afgeleid voor ziekteverwekkers in het drinkwater. Deze concentraties zijn zo laag dat ze niet of nauwelijks te meten zijn. Ook m.b.v. indicator-organismen is niet te bewijzen dat het drinkwater aan de wettelijke norm voldoet. Bij GWA wordt deze methode daarom aangevuld met de zogenaamde “total system approach”. Deze houdt onder meer in dat voor elke zuiveringstap bekend moet zijn wat de eliminatiecapaciteit is. Voor de ozonisatiestap kon nog niet aangetoond worden dat deze eliminatiecapaciteit ook gehaald werd. Uit eerdere metingen ontstond echter de indruk dat de behaalde diesinfectiecapaciteit van de ozonisatiestap in Weesperkarspel onvoldoende is. Om uit te vinden of dit ook werkelijk zo is, is er een model ontwikkeld wat het verloop van de ozonconcentratie in de ozonkelders berekent. Hieruit kan eenvoudig de voor desinfectie bepalende Ct-waarde bepaald worden. Met behulp van dit model kunnen vervolgens ook andere situaties doorgerekend worden zodat mogelijk een betere procesvoering gevonden kan worden.","ozonisatie; Weesperkarspel; drinkwater","nl","master thesis","Technische Universiteit Delft, Faculteit der Civiele Techniek en Geowetenschappen, Afdeling Watermanagement, Sectie Gezondheidstechniek","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","","","","",""

(mentor)","2002","There is ample evidence in literature that the insertion of flow obstacles in the coolant flow of a boiler postpones the f i lm dryout emergence on the heated surfaces. Specifically, the deposition of droplets forced by the obstacle is beheved to increase and is studied in this research. The two objectives of the present research are (i) to confirm the increase in the film flow rate, this by (ii) building an appropriate fiow-loop equipped with suited techniques for film thickness and film velocity measurements. A cylinder is inserted in the center of a vertical water-air annular tube flow. Variations in liquid film characteristics induced by the obstacle, especially the film thickness and interfacial parameters as disturbance waves velocity and frequency, are measured through (i) a conductance probes technique and (ii) a flow visualization technique. The LDA technique is also tried to be adapted to velocity measurements in the thin film. The presence of an obstacle in an annular fiow leads to an increase in the film thickness, and does not affect the interfacial behavior of the film. An increase in the droplet deposition constant is observed and agrees reasonably well with predictions from the Windecker et al. (1999) correlation. The fiowloop and the measurements techniques are suited for extensive droplet deposition measurements, provided the recommendations are adapted.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Applied Sciences","Kramers Laboratorium voor Fysische Technologie","","","",""

The country has suffered from several flood disasters in the past. A great part of the total length of dykes in Vietnam is located in the north of the country, in the densely populated Red River Delta. Flood protection works in the Red River Delta provide safety for twenty million people and enable vital economic activity. The population, the economic activity and the investments are expected to increase rapidly in the future, which will lead to an even greater flooding risk for the protection areas in the Red River Delta. In order to judge whether a flood protection system satisfies the socio-economic safety requirements, a risk analysis has proven to be an effective method. This study aims to introduce a method for risk assessment of flood protection systems in the Red River Delta. A risk analysis of a flood protection system consists of two important aspects. The first aspect is the calculation of the probability of failure of the system and the second aspect concerns the determination of the damage in the protected area in case the water defence fails. The multiplication of those two values determines the average annual damage or risk. The contribution of all elements of the water defence system and different failure mechanisms to the probability of the event 'flooding' can be calculated. As a result it is possible to analyse the effect of certain improvement measures on the average annual damage.","water defence; failure mechanisms; risk","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","","",""
