(mentor); Mul, E.J. (mentor)","2015","This report describes the process of my graduation project which is commissioned by the Civil Engineering consultancy agency Tauw (Technisch Adviesbureau van de Unie van Waterschappen). This graduation project was arranged by a research team at the faculty of Industrial Design Engineering, which work on the Nature Inspired Design methodology.This team has set- up a series of graduation projects to put the methodology into practise. Hereby the research team aquires deeper knowledge in the effectiveness of the methodology and the experiences of a designer working with the methodology. The goal of the project was to use the NID methodology in order to design a NID cycling path.This was a very broad starting point of the project, which means I had a lot of freadom to find an interesting design direction.To specify the project more, the Viruly cycling path, a recreational cycling path just outside of the city of Delft, was chosen as a case study. Since Tauw is a Civil Engineering consultancy agency, I didn’t have a lot of knowledge about their business. Therefore first a thorough internal and external research were conducted. Five interviews with employees with different specializations were held to learn more about cycling path design, but also the company’s goals and the strengths and weaknesses. I found their most valueble strengths to be their knowledge of soil and ecology, but also their striving for sustainability and an attractive living environment. Chapter 2 describes the context analysis at the Viruly cycling path, which plays a key role in the project.To design a succesfull NID product, which exists in harmony with its environment it is impor tant to find out what proper ties the environment has. What are the qualities of the environment and what aspects of the environment are vulnerable to change. The environment of the Viruly cycling path is natural and therefore very complex as it changes constantly. By analyzing (literature research, multiple observations, interviews) the Viruly cycling path and using the Life’s Principles of the NID methodology to test the quality of the facilities it was concluded that the resting facilities next to the recreational cycling path are of very bad quality and show a lot of room for improvement. Resting facilities should be more comfortable,but also enhance the natural experience during resting. A well designed resting area in nature helps people destress, gain renewed energy and thereby function better in the busy daily lifestyle, where mostly computer screen run people’s lives. . Chapter 3 describes the effect of nature on the physical and mental wellbeing and how nature’s properties can be used as inspiration and embodiment of products to enhance their natural feel. Also, research is done to find out the optimal ergonomical body postures for resting. Lying down is most effective as it releases most stress from the body. This led to the final design, a resting area positioned around a tree, inspired by a bird’s nest. The unique visual experience offers the user a view into the crown of the tree. This offers the user a new and interesting perspective on nature, something they would normally not come up with. Positioning the resting area around the tree and using it as the view itself, instead of removing the trees, to create an open view, also shows Tauw how to use nature’s qualities to increase the Experience value of the environment. The resting area is designed to offer users with different body lengths 5 different body postures to rest in. The goal of the resting area is to enhance the natural feel and qualities of the environment as much as possible.Therefore also natural materials (wood, soil & grass) are chosen as surface material.This way the resting area integrates with the environment and lets the user touch the environment and “become one with nature”. In the last phase, one of the ergonomical lying positions has been tested by the means of a 1:1 physical model.The test results have been translated into a final redesign, which I can recommend to be built on a 1:1 scale and let users optimally experience physical and mental rest, while enjoying the qualities","nature; inspired; design; resting; area; physical rest; mental rest; nature experience","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Design Engineering","","","",""

(mentor); Van Lieshout, P. (mentor)","2015","Marine and offshore structures are continuously exposed to different loading types. Cyclic loads results in cyclic stresses in structural components, which may result in degradation of the structural integrity. This process is called fatigue. Fatigue damage of structural components usually occurs without any —global— visible sign. Ultimately, damage in critical components of a structure may lead to catastrophic fracture, and must therefore be prevented. Currently, for uniaxial fatigue of welded joints several design techniques are available which are approved by classification societies. Research indicates that uniaxial fatigue life prediction methods results in a lifetime overestimation when they are applied on structural details exposed to multiaxial stress states. Experiments shows differences in calculated lifetime and real lifetime up to a factor 14. A new method based on the Verity structural stress and a path dependent maximum range (PDMR) cycle counting algorithm proposed by researchers of Battelle was implemented in a software by the author. As study object a welded detail in a flex-lay tower structure installed on a vessel is used. This new method, based on the Verity structural stress and PDMR cycle counting directly takes into account the effect of the multiaxiality. Comparison of the results of the new proposed method is made to the methods presently prescribed by Eurocode 3 and IIW classification codes. Present methods instruct algebraic summation of the damage due to normal and shear stress in case of a multiaxial loaded welds. For the method by the codes the hotspot stress in combination with rainflow cycle counting are applied. For a proportional loaded weld in the flex-lay tower, the new proposed method shows a factor 3 higher damage than the presently methods described. A non-proportional stress state suitable for analysis is not found in the flex-lay tower; therefore a realistic one was obtained by modification of proportional data. Comparison of the proportional and non-proportional stress histogram shows that on average the non-proportional stress state has more cycles in the region of the mode and higher ranges at the cost of the cycles at the ranges positioned left of the mode. For the non-proportional loaded weld, the new proposed method shows a factor 4.2 higher damage than calculated using the current class codes. The research shows using an advanced method, significant higher damage levels are calculated, which may be validated in future experiments. The focus of this research was on the loading side i.e. use of correct stress components, cycle counting method and implementation thereof in software. The author recommends to research the resistance side as well, for example types of S-N curve to be used for proportional and non-proportional loaded welds.","Multiaxial fatigue; PDMR; Verity Structural Stress; Fatigue","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2040-03-31","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Maritime & Transport Technology","","Ship and Offshore Structures","",""

A proposed re-insurance system, FloodRe, is suggested to improve the UK flood insurance system, but lacks the needed risk management incentive to be a constructive solution to the problem. An agent-based model of a flood prone UK housing market area is developed and the working of FloodRe and flood protection measures are explored. Results from experiments run on the model show that the current setup of FloodRe does not affect the UK housing market other than making flood insurance premiums affordable. The proposed flood protection measures are effective but are not themselves affected by FloodRe in any way. It is recommended to do further research in using the information that FloodRe provides to incentivise flood risk management among persons and the government. In this way a FloodRe system can be set up that aids in keeping flood prone areas in the UK affordable and liveable.","flooding; United Kingdoms; London; flood insurance; FloodRe; agent-based modelling","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Technology, Policy and Management","Energy & Industry","","Systems Engineering, Policy Analysis and Management","",""

Under certain conditions this friction force can alternate between static and kinetic, which can cause jerky motions between the two sliding objects and finally high spring load peaks. In this study the stick-slip effects on a moored vessel in head-on ice conditions are studied.

(mentor); Slinger, J.H. (mentor); De Jong, W.M. (mentor); Janssen, S.K.H. (mentor)","2015","Coastal erosion is a natural process caused by the actions of current and waves towards coastlines. Building with Nature (BwN), is an emerging methodology that utilizes natural process and natural materials to reduce the impacts of coastal erosion on nature and society. Because of the involvement of natural materials and natural processes, BwN proactively embraces uncertainties in the coastal management projects, which deviates from customary methods of coastal management that reduce uncertainties. Therefore, it is meaningful to investigate uncertainties in the BwN projects and how uncertainties influence decision making processes of the BwN projects. This master thesis project selects a BwN sand nourishment project in Ystad, Sweden (in short, the Ystad project) for case study. The research aims to analyze uncertainties in the BwN sand nourishment projects and identify influential uncertainties in decision making processes of the BwN projects. In order to achieve the research objective, the master thesis project starts with a literature review on existing theories of uncertainty analysis, including different definitions and classifications of uncertainties. Based on previous research, a BwN uncertainty matrix is established to reveal uncertainties and different perceptions of uncertainties. Three dimensions, including the location, level and nature of uncertainty, are used to depict uncertainties in the BwN projects. This master thesis project applies the BwN uncertainty matrix to analyze the data collected by desk research and the field research in Sweden. Uncertainties exist in all the natural, technical and societal systems in the decision making process of the Ystad project. Uncertainties regarding issues in the societal system are addressed most frequently, while technical uncertainties are rarely raised by respondents. Different perceptions of uncertainties, particularly regarding environmental impacts of sand nourishment and the availability of sand resource for sand nourishment are essential and affected the decision making process. Ystad Municipality, as project owner and local authority in Ystad, made a lot of efforts to break through the delayed decision making process by providing knowledge, persuasive communication and interactive scale framing. The main contribution of the master thesis is developing an actor-based BwN uncertainty matrix to identify uncertainties and compare different perceptions of uncertainties in the BwN projects. It is also the first time to have a qualitative uncertainty analysis for the first sand nourishment project in Sweden.","Building with Nature; sand nourishment; uncertainty; Ystad","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Technology, Policy and Management","Policy Analysis","","Engineering and Policy Analysis","",""

(mentor); De Jong, P. (mentor)","2015","For over a century, model tests have supported in ship and offshore structures design. Experimental results can be used to (1) validate theory to apply numerical simulations in the design and (2) for design by testing, directly using the (scaled) results in the design. Recently, at the Ship Hydromechanics and Structures lab of the TU Delft, a series of experiments was carried out with a 1/20 scale 42 m fast patrol vessel. The model was segmented to enable internal loads measurement. Unfortunately the results were unsatisfactory, in all probability due to errors in the measurement set-up. As a consequence, a new routine of the numerical program fasthip could not be validated. The current research goal was to identify flaws of the prior measurement set-up, develop an improved set-up and determine its performance. First, a broad range of experiments was conducted to gain a deeper understanding of the load path of the previously used set-up. By systematically increasing the disturbance factors, the defects in the set-up could be identified. Due to its versatility and relative easy construction, the two segment rigid backbone construction was used. Two measurement options were developed and implemented, both with the aim to measure the vertical bending moment amidships. The bending moment was measured: 1. Indirectly using 9 force transducers. 2. Directly using 4 coupled fixed strain gauges. The set-up was tested before final assembly. This included an extensive calibration of the strain gauges placed directly on the backbone. Hereafter, experiments with increasing complexity were carried out. During calm water tests, the model was towed at a range of forward speeds. The equations forming the indirect method were verified using the measurement data and the free-free beam boundary conditions. To assess the performance in dynamic conditions, the model was towed at three velocities through a frequency range of regular head waves, forming 48 conditions. The signals were processed using a digital band pass filter and fitted against the excitation frequency. Inertia correction at the indirect method was conducted per time step by using the backbone mass properties and the vertical and rotational accelerations. The methods were compared regarding the bending moment values and the associated 95% confidence limits. Both options deliver equal and accurate results in calm water tests. In regular head waves the required processing to obtain the indirectly measured vertical bending moment proved specific and devious. This leaves the direct method the preferred choice for in particular the semi-planing regime velocities. By increased adaption of the backbone design to the expected excitation forces, the confidence bound limits will turn out more favorable. For this, it is key to incorporate a structural member with limited mass and obtain the required strain levels at the section cuts while maintaining sufficient global stiffness to avoid unwanted resonance. The improved measurement accuracy will further enlarge the practicability of measurement results for direct use in the design and numerical code validation.","Internal Load Towing Tank Segmented Ship Model","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2018-03-31","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Offshore and Dredging Engineering","","","",""

By admixing nanoparticles in the aerosol phase, these can evenly be distributed in the fractal-like metal oxide structure. The nanofiber network is a polymer and is produced by electrospinning [77]. It serves as an initial support, while the structure supports itself after forming a certain thickness. Spark discharge is used to produce the active nanoparticles as well as the support [11]. Rapid diffusion limited aggregation governs the deposition process, guaranteeing formation of the fractal-like structure [38]. Due to the flexible nature of the spark discharge process, a virtually unlimited number of combinations of oxide supports, metals, alloys and bi-catalysts can be made. The method proved to work for titanium dioxide, aluminium oxide and magnesium oxide catalystsupports. Combinations of these metal oxides with gold and platinum proved the broad applicability of the method. The process can be called environmentally friendly, since it does not use any solvents or produce any hazardous waste. Initial photocatalytic experiments on titanium dioxide nanostructures were carried out to test the catalytic activity of the material. It was observed that the titanium dioxide nanostructures were amorphous, but still exhibited catalytic properties. Adding gold nanoparticles to the nanostructures lowered the catalytic effect. In-situ annealing of amorphous titanium dioxide nanoparticles, before admixing gold nanoparticles, yielded highly porous fractal-like crystalline titanium dioxide nanostructures with gold nanoparticles on the surface.","nanoparticles; catalysis; fractals; nanotechnology","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Applied Sciences","Chemical Engineering","","Materials for Energy Conversion & Storage (MECS)","",""

(mentor)","2015","Over the last few years the need of new alternatives to traditional disease modelling, drug screening and toxicity tests has boosted the development of a new class of devices called Organ on Chip. These usually consist in a substrate or a well in which cells are cultured with the aim of differentiating them in a particular tissue lineage. With sensors and actuators integrated in the device, a culturing environment, as close as possible to in vivo one, is reproduced. This stimulates both cell differentiation and viability, boosting model reliability in this way. An instance of this class of devices is the Heart on Chip developed by Philips Research in collaboration with TU Delft. This device, also know as Cytostretch device, is a stretchable polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) membrane embedding a micro-electrode array meant to mea- sure the electrical activity of cardiomyocytes grown on the top of the membrane. Unlike most of previous organ-on-chip designs, the Cytostretch device was developed aiming at fabricating a clean-room compatible product. This should guarantee a large-scale fabrication and a rapid commercialization. Besides this, Philips Research team focused on the mechanical properties of the membrane by opting for a polymer-last approach. These design choices led to the fabrication of multi-electrode array characterized by an electrode-electrolyte impedance too high for the detection of the low-amplitude biopotential signals coming from the cells. In order to solve this problem, the integration of carbon nanotube (CNT) electrodes into the Cytostretch device will be considered; CNT forests have been widely used to coat biopo- tential electrodes since they guarantee intrinsically large surface area as well as low electrode- electrolyte impedance. To the best of authors knowledge, this is the first attempt to embed CNT electrodes in an Organ on Chip. Moreover, this is the first work which aims to produce a CNT multiple electrode array with a large-scale fabrication, a fully clean-room compatible process and a polymer-last approach. This project had three main goals. Firstly, it aimed to characterize Cobalt-grown CNTs as bio-electrode coating. Secondly, it verified the feasibility of a novel fabrication process which allows to embed CNT electrodes in a PDMS membrane without the need to perform critical manual steps and last but not least, it aimed to prove the biocompatibility of CNTs as bio-electrode coating in in vitro tests including human induced pluripotential stem cells.","Carbon Nanotube; Micro electrode array; electrochemical impedance spectroscopy; iPSC; Human Induced pluripotential stem cell; CNT; MEA; EIS; Organ on Chip; PDMS; membrane; cardiomyocyte; cardiac","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2017-03-30","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Biomedical Engineering","","Biomedical Electronics","",""

(mentor); Zinke, C. (mentor)","2015","Minimizing the time needed to travel a prescribed distance is the main development goal in motorsports. In racing car development, simulations are used to predict the effect of design parameter changes on vehicle performance. If approached as an optimal trajectory planning problem, a maneuver simulation can be used to determine not only the maneuver time, but also to identify the performance limitations on the system. This thesis describes the development and implementation of an optimal trajectory planning method using optimal control for short maneuvers. The requirements and modeling decisions are based on the application of the method to example problems related to TC design. The model for the method is based on a study of steady-state acceleration limits and stability. The rigid two-track model resulting from this study includes lateral and longitudinal load transfer, a nonlinear tire model, a limited-slip differential and aerodynamic downforce. An important contribution is the omission of wheel rotational velocities from the model, reducing the number of states by four and relaxing the requirements on the discretization interval. Possible misuse of this formulation is prevented by a constraint representing wheel rotational stability limitations. The formulation is validated by comparison to a reference model which includes wheel rotational velocities. The optimal trajectory planning method is formulated as an optimal control problem. The cost function is the maneuver time, and the constraints consist of the system dynamics and maneuver boundaries. The time-based dynamics are transformed into spatial dynamics, and a curvilinear coordinate system is used. The optimal control problem is discretized using a full collocation method, and the state and input trajectories are parametrized in terms of B-spline coefficients. The resulting problem is solved using a NLP solver. Interior-point solver IPOPT and SQP solver SNOPT are compared on various small problems. For this application IPOPT appears to be superior over SNOPT. The first order derivative information of the constraints required for IPOPT is approximated using sparse-finite differences, and the cost function gradient is calculated analytically. The precision of the method is assessed in a study of maneuver time dependency on mass. It appears that precision is mainly affected by convergence of the solver to various local minima. As such, the use of distance-dependent constraints and warm-start are employed for improving precision. The optimal trajectory for a hairpin with various radii is studied in detail. Special attention is paid to tire friction potential utilization and vehicle stability according the Lyapunov's First Method. For the given parameters it is shown that the optimal solution involves instances of overdriving either the front or rear axle. It is also shown that the vehicle is open-loop locally unstable on intervals along the optimal trajectory. In another simulation study, the reaction of the control inputs to temporary reductions in tire-road friction and perturbations to the yaw rate and body slip angle on turn-exit are evaluated. The most important result of this study is that the longitudinal control was found to be the primary means for rejecting such disturbances. The study also showed that steering angle changes are used as additional means for disturbance rejection if the perturbation is large enough to saturate the reduction of longitudinal control. The sensitivity of maneuver time and optimal trajectory to vehicle mass is studied by the use of so-called sensitivity differentials. This is done using a well-developed theoretical framework for parametric sensitivity for barrier methods, implemented in the software package sIPOPT. The sensitivity study can be seen as a proof of concept of the sensitivity differential approach for the race car MTM application.","optimal control; race car; IPOPT; NLP","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","DCSC","","Systems and Control","",""

The load path in these types of structures is different compared to a straight viaduct. Increase of torsional moments is expected. Currently there is not a lot of knowledge available about the distribution of forces, mainly concerning shear and torsion, in these types of viaducts. More research is needed to understand the real behavior of these structures and how these can be modelled in a finite element program. The current method of analyzing this type of structures is to use an orthotropic plate model. The shear force and torsional moments cause an increase of the shear stresses in the webs of the girder. This phenomenon cannot be analyzed using an orthotropic plate model because of the difference in cross-sections. In the Eurocode and literature a method approach is provided to be able to translate these forces in a plate model in to shear stresses in the box girder. In this thesis two models are analyzed in DIANA: an orthotropic plate model and a more complex 2,5D shell model. The results of both analyses are compared with each other and the differences are investigated. The analysis is based on a typical box beam viaduct and only the linear elastic stage is considered. The focus is on the comparison of models for the load distributions rather than determining the required reinforcement and capacity calculations. The self-weight and prestressing do not cause torsion in a girder because these loads are applied for the statically determined beam in the factory. The internal forces due to these loads are calculated separately and therefore not inserted in the models. For the Eurocode loading it was found that the maximum value for the longitudinal moment was overestimated by 3,5 percent with the orthotropic plate model when the moment due to the self-weight and the prestressing was taken in to account. The maximum value for the shear stresses was overestimated by the orthotropic plate model 18% when the shear stresses due to the self-weight and prestressing are taken in to account. This led to 23% more shear reinforcement. It is expected that the 2,5D shell model will take two weeks longer to analyze. This means that this will cost 7200 euro for engineering. It is therefore not worth to use the 2,5D shell model to save up money for shear reinforcement (2500 euro) only. It is advised to use the orthotropic plate model for the analysis of new skew box beam viaducts with a skew angle of 60 degrees and the same dimensions as the case study viaduct. This model approach is cost efficient if the design is based on maximum values for the shear stress and the same stirrups are applied over the length of the girder. In case of a reassessment of an existing viaduct where the combination of shear force and torsional moment are governing, the difference of 18% for the shear stress could be decisive in whether the viaduct fulfills the current codes and requirements or not (with the present shear reinforcement). The use of the 2,5D shell model should then be reconsidered.","DIANA; skew; viaducts; comparison; models","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Structural Engineering","","Concrete structures","",""

Conclusions from the studies analyzed vary and these studies have their shortcomings. This study reflects critically on these previous studies in order to promote better research and to reveal a small piece of the puzzle called ‘integrated contract forms’. Empirical findings from a case control study of thirty secondary schools indicate that the use of integrated contract forms do not provide the expected benefits to time performance when compared to traditional contract forms. The data was collected from project managers via online questionnaires. However, when there is above average time pressure during the development process, parties tend to choose for integrated contracts because they assume that projects developed in this way have faster processes than projects developed with traditional contracts.","integrated contract forms; time effects; empirical study; case control study; statistical analysis","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2015-03-25","Architecture and The Built Environment","Real Estate and Housing","","Design- and Construction Management","",""

(mentor); Wolters, B. (mentor); Houben, G.J.P. (mentor)","2015","Paying at an online shop is easy for a shopper but the process behind it can become rather complex. The actual transaction travels through the systems of multiple different stakeholders like processors, banks and payment schemes. Multiple available stakeholders allow for optimizations. This work focuses on optimization of transaction routing between payment schemes to minimize transaction costs. Payment routing between schemes is only possible for dual branded payment methods and becomes challenging when schemes differ in functionality. The difference in support for refunds is an example of such a difference which is crucial for retail merchants. In this work a refund predictor for individual transactions is used to predict refund behavior which enables routing between schemes with different support for refunds. The research can be split into two parts; First it is shown that existing evaluation methods cannot deal with the presented criteria, specific to the routing context. The difference in individual transaction costs seem to be uncovered by all methods. In addition an evaluation method, called Current Optimal Instance Score (cOIS), is defined which is based on the realistic loss function from literature. The proposed evaluation method is evaluated in comparison to the loss function from literature. Choosing the right parameters of a predictor using this new evaluation method improves the performance such that 8% of the costs are reduced. For the second part a refund predictor is designed which is able to predict if an individual transaction eventually will be refunded when it enters the system. This predictor is used and optimized for route optimization between schemes which differ in refund support and fees. A sample weight strategy is designed to add some weight to transactions which make the biggest difference in costs. In this research it is shown that transactions costs can be optimized by routing transactions with the knowledge of a refund classifier. Using cOIS, the proposed evaluation method, the final system is validated at a score of 0.487. This result shows that we are halfway in optimizing costs, from the current costs to the theoretical optimum. In practice this system resulted in a cost reduction of 36% which equals to 1.4% of a merchant its profits.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2020-03-19","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Web Information Systems","","Information Architecture","",""

(mentor)","2015","Artificially aged aluminium-lithium alloys have recently seen renewed interest in them in the aviation industry. They have a decreased density, while keeping or improving the fatigue properties compared to other aluminium alloys. Research shows that these aluminium-lithium and other advanced aluminium alloys exhibit crack turning and crack. Currently no predictive capabilities exist for such phenomena, therefore designers cannot use the full potential of these alloys. This study aims at the development of a numerical strategy that can predict in-plane crack turning and crack branching in a crack-arrestor configuration. Additionally, fatigue tests have been performed in this study to gain insight into the effects of crack turning and crack branching on the fatigue crack life, crack paths and FCGR. The fatigue test coupons are manufactured in seven different orientations in the ST-L material plane, where the L-axis has been rotated increasingly w.r.t the expected mode-I crack growth direction. Two different aluminium alloys are used in these tests, Al 2050-T84 and Al 7010-T7451. Lastly, the main drivers are established for both in-plane crack turning and crack branching in a crack arrestor configuration. Two separate numerical methods are developed in this study, the k2-method and the Pettit-method. Both methods are based on a LEFM framework. The key hypotheses of the k2-method have been judged to be invalid. On the other hand, the key assumptions for the Pettit method have proven to be very reasonable. The Pettit-method uses the MSERR approach combined with a method to account for fatigue fracture resistance anisotropy, dependent on the orientation of the microstructure and Kmax of the primary crack. A comparison of the predictions with the crack paths observed in the fatigue tests, shows that the Pettit-method is accurate for coupon orientations in between ST00-L and ST45-L. Fractography of a branch in an Al 2050-T84 DEN(T) coupon revealed that void growth and coalescence was the primary fracture process. A recent study confirms that void growth and coalescence is the primary fracture process for crack branches in a crack arrestor configuration. A combination of shielding and amplification effects on a microstructure level is responsible for this void growth, which concentrates on grain boundaries between favourable stiff/soft grain pairings. These observations make it unlikely that crack branching in a crack arrestor configuration can be predicted with macroscopic crack growth criteria. The main driver for the crack turning and fatigue fracture resistance anisotropy, observed in the fatigue tests, likely is the orientation of the microstructure w.r.t the primary crack and loading direction. Numerical simulations reveal that turning cracks grow in near mode-I conditions, which is confirmed by fractography of such a turning crack path. The fact that such cracks grow in near mode-I conditions, makes them well predictable with macroscopic crack growth criteria, as proven by the predictions of the Pettit-method.","fatigue crack growth; crack branching; crack turning; numerical; experiments; aluminium-lithium","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","Aerospace Structures and Materials","","Structural Integrity and Composites","",""

(mentor); Buijs, J.A. (mentor)","2015","Recent technological development in the field of head mounted displays (HMD) like the Oculus Rift and 360° 3D cameras present new opportunities for virtual reality. VR-Producties.nl (and videoproducties.nl) want to expand their portfolio by producing immersive 360° video content. However, several larger competitors and major broadcasting stations are currently exploring the possibilities of this new form of media. Finally, VR-Producties.nl and me decided that exploring the possibilities in this promising but new market would be a good subject for my graduation thesis: How could VR-Producties.nl become successful in the immersive video market? In the analysis phase, an internal and external analysis was performed. The market and competitors were analysed and a SWOT matrix was created. Based on the information found in this phase, it was concluded that the competition in this new market was very high and that VR-Producties.nl would need to find a new application that could add value or revenues for a client. The main challenge that was defined after the analysis phase was: to leverage from the existing client network, while making use of their network of experienced freelancers, in order to ward of the possible competitors. The application should generate extra revenues or publicity for the involved client. A list of possible application for immersive video was created. Internally, a few ideas of which we believed they were great business opportunities for VR-Producties.nl were selected for further analysis. A survey among 428 people from the United States was conducted to find out which of these selected applications was the most interesting or fun, but also to find out if people were familiar with the Oculus Rift and if they were willing to buy a head mounted display in the future. The application of a virtual guided tour through historical and cultural heritage sites was considered the most interesting and fun. Furthermore it was concluded that the market for head mounted displays (HMD) still had to grow in order to be profitable for content creators like VR-Producties.nl. Instead of selling the content to HMD owners, it was concluded that the developed content should offer a client the ability to expand their customer base. During the project I tried to involve a lot of potential clients. A lot of emails were sent to organizations that are concerned with historical or cultural heritage and publishers. They were all interested in my ideas, but none of them were willing to invest in the production of this immersive content. Finally, the Anne Frank museum was convinced of the added value the content could provide for their organization. They were interested in producing an immersive digital guided tour through the Secret Annex. They can use immersive video to: 1: Offer a guided tour to visitors with a physical impairment (at the museum) 2: Offering a guided tour to schools and organizations that would normally visit the Anne Frank museum. A mobile exhibition (at another location) 3: Offer a sneak preview to people around the world that own a HMD and want to see what the museum has to offer (from any location) Since immersive video is something new, there were no clear methods or guidelines available for developing the content. Based on information that was found online, a method for recording, producing and offering the immersive video was suggested. This method reduces the costs for filming immersive video while it improves the comfort for the user or viewer. The Anne Frank museum indicated that they were thinking of offering the content to visitors with a physical impairment inside the café of the museum. They also stated that in 2015, the museum would be reconstructed. A concept was developed for visitors with a physical impairment (Scenario 1) The concept improves the safety of the viewer and other visitors. Instead of driving and turning around blindly while wearing a HMD, the concept ensures that the user will remain safely in the same spot of the exhibition. This chapter includes an evaluation of the service designed for schools and recommendations on how this service could be offered in the near future. Based on the information that was gathered during focus group interviews with teachers, a roadmap was created. VR-Producties.nl and other museums or organizations concerned with cultural or historical heritage sites can use this roadmap to offer the additional services (scenario 2 and 3 in the business models) and develop suitable content. The report concludes with my own overall evaluation of this graduation project and closing remarks.?","immersive video; oculus rift; museum; digital guided tour","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Product Innovation Management","","SPD","",""

(mentor); De Lille, C.S.H. (mentor)","2015","City branding is becoming increasingly important as a tool for cities to distinguish themselves and to create an attractive image. Competition between cities is growing as they are aiming to attract the same target groups in order to grow their local economy with access to high educated talent, enterprises, and funding. In this competitive environment a strong City brand is an important differentiator. Also, the municipality of Rotterdam is in the process of developing a strong city brand to support the future of the city. Considering that small and medium enterprises make up over 90% of the businesses in the Netherlands, the central question in this project is how to apply city branding to connect small and medium enterprises to the city of Rotterdam. The first step in this process is understanding the scope. Three segments were explored : city branding theory, internal research of municipality of Rotterdam, and the external context of Rotterdam, that is the city brand, and small and medium enterprises (SMEs). City branding is a bottom-up principle and the aim is to find a group of SMEs in Rotterdam that represent the city. Through an in-depth analysis 10 key insights were formulated. On the basis of these insights a group of SMEs in the city was selected who are yet to become a part of the municipal SME policy; the makers, creators, and innovators. This group is a component of an international trend of local manufacturing, which is enabled by rapid developments in digital manufacturing and design. The next step is deepening the knowledge about this focus group. The selected group of SMEs does not fit the description of established industries, but it has similarities to the creative industry and the manufacturing industry. For this reason this group is classified as Urban Manufacturing. Urban Manufacturing includes small companies that design, develop and manufacture tangible products within the borders of the city. The methods of manufacturing range from craftsmanship to high tech. The group flourishes in Rotterdam and is attracted by core strengths of the city and, besides being an interesting addition to the current city brand, the focus group can have an influence on the development of the city; on the infrastructure, the society, and the economy. The core elements of the vision form the groundwork of the third step; designing a brand strategy for the municipality. In this brand strategy the bottom-up principle of city branding is applied. The five strategic elements are mentality and pride, space in the city, forming an industry, connecting stakeholders, and establishing a strong city brand. These five strategic elements are translated into tactics for the municipality to implement the brand strategy. The implementation plan is visualized in a roll out scheme based on a ten year plan, with set targets linking back to the five strategic elements.","City Branding; Rotterdam; Small and Medium Enterprises; Branding Strategy; Urban Manufacturing","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Product Innovation Management","","Master of Science Strategic Product Design","",""

(mentor)","2015","Solid round bars with a shoulder fillet are frequently used in engineering structures because it facilitates a smooth transition in thickness. However, the presence of shoulder fillets is currently neglected in the prediction of fatigue crack growth in engineering practice. Since stress concentrating locations like a shoulder fillet can have a significant effect on the fatigue crack growth behaviour, neglecting the presence of a shoulder fillet may introduce unacceptable inaccuracies in the current fatigue crack growth predictions done in solid round bars with a shoulder fillet. Experimental research was done on characterizing the effect of shoulder fillets on the fatigue crack growth behaviour in solid round bars loaded in tension. The problem was approached from two points of view: the conventional stress intensity approach and a novel energy approach. Proven methodologies were used for the stress intensity approach, the energy approach had a more exploratory character. The first goal of the research was to investigate the influence of a shoulder fillet on the fatigue crack growth behaviour in solid round bars loaded in tension. The influence of a shoulder fillet was quantified by the development of a stress intensity solution based on the results of fatigue crack growth experiments. The developed stress intensity factor solution was implemented in a fatigue crack growth prediction model for solid round bars with a shoulder fillet loaded in tension. The stress intensity factor range is conventionally used as similarity parameter to predict fatigue crack growth. An issue with this similarity parameter that has received a lot of attention in the past decades is the effect of the stress ratio. Empirically derived equations are proposed in literature to take the effect of the stress ratio into account for fatigue crack growth predictions. Recent literature suggests that this effect of the stress ratio is a reflection of the inadequacy of the stress intensity factor range to uniquely describe the applied load cycle; it was suggested that these stress ratio correction equations mostly compensate for the fact that cyclic stress has been used in a methodology where cyclic energy should have been used instead. The second goal of the research was to investigate how the energy used for a fatigue crack to grow in a complete load cycle relates to the fatigue crack growth rate. A prediction methodology was developed based on the energy released in a complete fatigue cycle rather than at maximum and/or minimum load as is the case in the conventional stress intensity approach. It was found that the average cyclic strain energy release rate could be used as similarity parameter in the developed methodology. The methodology was used to develop fatigue crack growth prediction model for solid round bars with a shoulder fillet loaded in tension. As a result of the research project, it was concluded that the developed fatigue crack growth prediction model, which makes use of the developed stress intensity factor solution, is able to predict fatigue crack growth for different shoulder fillet geometries at one stress ratio; it was less accurate at other stress ratios. It is recommended to do further research to validate the developed stress intensity factor solution. Next to that, it was concluded that the proposed prediction methodology with the average cyclic strain energy release rate as similarity parameter was able to predict fatigue crack growth independently of the applied stress ratio and shoulder fillet geometry. Points of further research are identified to continue the development of the average cyclic strain energy release rate as similarity parameter for the prediction of fatigue crack growth in general.","fatigue crack growth; experiments; shoulder fillet; stress intensity factor; strain energy release rate; prediction","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","Aerospace Structures and Materials","","Structural Integrity and Composites","",""

(mentor)","2015","Introduction: One of the factors that contribute to the total needle-targeting error in medical procedures is needle deflection, which can lead to e.g. hemorrhage, prolonged intervention time and decreased treatment efficiency. This deflection can be defined as the deviation of the needle from its suspected straight insertion path. In this study, we focused on the effect of tissue heterogeneity on needle deflection. We hypothesized that needle deflection would be bigger for insertions into heterogeneous than homogeneous specimens, due to an unequal force distribution on the needle. Method: the inner needle of a 18Gauge trocar needle with triangular tip was inserted (5mm/s) multiple times at several positions into 4 gelatin-, 4 animal liver-, and 2 human liver specimens. Deflection in X- and Y-direction was measured using sliding gauges and axial forces acting on the needle were captured using a force sensor mounted onto the needle hub. Axial force analysis was used to give a rough estimation of the mechanical properties of the specimens. Results: Results show an increase in magnitude and variance for needle insertions into the liver specimens (Animal: Mean = 1.01mm, SD = 0.54, Human: Mean = 0.83mm, SD = 0.48) compared with those into gelatin specimens (Mean = 0.59mm, SD = 0.26mm). Differences between the median and maximal needle tip forces for insertions into gelatin were almost zero (Mean = 0.08, SD = 0.04N), whereas those differences were bigger for insertions into tissue specimens (Mean = 0.58, SD = 0.23N), indicating the homogeneous nature of gelatin and heterogeneous nature of tissue. Discussion: The results obtained in this study suggest that heterogeneity causes the needle to deflect from its straight path. Both magnitude and variance of needle deflection are bigger for insertions into heterogeneous tissue specimens than into homogeneous gelatin specimens. A suggestion for future research is to study the effect of pathologic tissue on needle deflection, as this type of tissue is known for being more heterogeneous than healthy tissue.","needle deflection; heterogeneity; gelatin; liver","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2015-04-03","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","BioMechanical Engineering","","","",""

(mentor); Hemmes, K. (mentor)","2015","The main focus of this thesis has been to gain an understanding on the key challenges for self-organization between the relevant stakeholders necessary for rolling out a North Sea Offshore Grid. The North Sea Offshore Grid (NSOG) is an important component in the realization of the renewable energy potential in different European countries. Up till now no commonly accepted strategy has been composed for rolling out this offshore grid in a coordinated way. This lack of a commonly accepted strategy is affecting the trust and progress in international collaboration and in the coordinate development of national visions. This lack of coordination increases the risk for lock-in effects leading to sub-optimal development pathways. The current research and practices on the valuation of optimal grid configuration has been based on the comparison of costs and benefits of the different policy options. This research has taken a different approach, and has looked at the different stakeholder perspectives on developments in the offshore wind industry. Results show multiple challenges currently blocking a coordinated NSOG rollout. One of the major challenges is the discrepancy and the lack of common ground between stakeholders on the monetization, composition and distribution of these costs and benefits. These disagreements on costs and benefits are not likely to be resolved by yet another improved effort at classic cost-benefit analysis. Also, the identification of costs and benefits for individual projects lacks the synergy effects of a total grid. Other important challenges identified are the lack of profitability and high risk level of making (anticipatory) investments necessary to facilitate a future grid expansion and the lack of trust between the different stakeholder on future commitment and collaboration. The combination of these challenges has resulted in an equilibrium of stakeholders defecting and performing free-riders behavior, waiting for others to take the risk and invest in sufficient offshore wind capacity necessary for allowing for profitable business case to be set up. It has thus been argued that focus of the current discussions should shift from identifying the most efficient project or grid configuration, towards a discussion about ways how to increasing the willingness of Member States to express their long-term financial commitment towards the development of the grid and accept the investment risks by putting the costs and benefits of the NSOG in a broader perspective of potential gains for the individual Member States. This research has used the SES-framework and the self-organization theory from Ostrom as tools for structuring and reflecting on the results. However, both the framework as the theory have been initially developed for ecological systems. Since the North Sea Offshore Grid is a Social Technical System (STS), a second line of research which has been presented in this report is related to the applicability of both the framework and the theory on comparable STS.","offshore wind; North Sea Offshore Grid; self-organization; stakeholder perceptions; technological and institutional integrations; SES-framework","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2015-03-29","Technology, Policy and Management","Systems Engineering, Policy Analysis and Managment","","Energy & Industry","",""

(mentor)","2015","This thesis addresses the process of airfoil optimization for vertical axis wind turbines (VAWT). The airfoils are designed for large scale turbines above 5 MW. The VAWT concept is relevant for offshore floating wind energy, because of its low center of gravity (stability) and their simplicity (low maintenance). An optimal tip speed ratio of 4-4.5 is chosen with an average Reynolds number of 5 million. The solidity c/R of the turbine is 0.1. These operation conditions are representative for the new generation VAWT. The goal of this thesis is to develop an optimization process for VAWT airfoils and to demonstrate it by designing an airfoil, while taking into account airfoil soiling. A literature review presents the previous research in VAWT airfoil design, showing that no consensus has been previously reached about VAWT airfoil design. From the literature review an optimization objective derived by Simão Ferreira [30] is chosen. The airfoil is optimized for aerodynamic and structural performance. The aerodynamics is assessed on airfoil level according to the objective of lift slope over drag. Structurally, the airfoil will be optimized for flapwise bending stiffness. Airfoil soiling is simulated on the airfoil by using turbulent transition. A genetic optimization tool for airfoils coupled with RFOIL, an airfoil analysis tool, is used to generate VAWT airfoils. The objective function values are calculated using the aerodynamic coefficients from RFOIL and the geometric properties of the airfoils. The optimization process is validated by analyzing the results with three different models for full VAWT analysis. These models are: 1) an inviscid panel model coupled with RFOIL, 2) a double wake panel model and 3) a CFD model. Three airfoils resulting from the optimization are tested using the aerodynamic models. The performance of the airfoils validates the objective functions, but performance for the soiled case is not satisfactory. These preliminary findings were presented at the 33rd Wind Energy Symposiumat the AIAA SciTech conference [32], the full paper can be found in appendix B Five different strategies are developed to optimize airfoils. The results are analyzed using a double wake panel model. The optimization strategy in which airfoils are optimized for soiled conditions results in the best performing airfoils. The RK2-27 is a demonstration airfoil resulting from this optimization strategy. The CP of this airfoil for a tip speed ratio of 4 and a solidity of 0.1 is 0.53 in the clean case and 0.45 in the soiled case. This was determined by both the inviscid panel model and the double wake panel model. The RK2-27 has an increased CP compared to the NACA 0018 of 0.04 in the clean case at the design operating conditions. The CP in the soiled case is only 0.02 lower than the NACA 0018. The maximum thickness of the airfoil increased by 50% from 18% to 27%.

(mentor); Van de Ven, F.H.M. (mentor); Hooimeijer, F.L. (mentor); Dolman, N.C. (mentor)","2015","The overarching aim of this research project was to establish a sustainable urban water management design for Hoboken City to decrease vulnerability to extreme precipitation and improve urban quality. By carrying out a functional analysis of the area and the technical analysis of the water system, recommendations were made for soft and natural spatial solutions (i.e. blue-green measures). The base of the design is the existing urban environment, which is characterised by low area elevations, dense urban development, and high impermeability. The gravity based sewer system drains storm water into the Hudson River through combined sewer overflow valves. During high tide, the overflow valves close, preventing the storm water to overflow, whereby the surplus water remaining in the sewer pipes overflows in low-lying areas. Natural processes were used to recreate a naturally oriented water cycle. The main goals of the urban design were to reduce storm water floods, reduce the number of combined sewer overflows into the Hudson River, and improving the urban living environment. Urban quality was indicated by air quality, public green- and recreational space, and the reduction of urban heat island effects. The research question as a guide for the thesis reads: ‘What system of blue- green adaptation measures is most beneficial for Hoboken in terms of flood reduction and improving the urban quality?’ Various research methods are used to answer this question. To gain knowledge regarding urban water management and nature based flood adaptation measures, a literature review is conduced. tudies towards flooding and flood reduction in Hoboken were used as input for the water assignment. To design sets of blue-green measures, a functional analysis of the area is done using the six-layer approach for urban areas. With the approach, design opportunities and constraints for different layers are identified. The design strategies of appropriate blue-green measures for Hoboken are tested in a hydrology-hydraulic water management model. Results Hoboken suffers both flash flooding overwhelming the sewer system and storm surge. Low elevations and high groundwater levels influence infiltration capacity and efficiency of the drainage system. Combined sewer outlets with valves to the Hudson River carry excess water directly into the river during storms. When heavy rainfall coincides with high tide, excess water backs up in the sewer, causing flood nuisance in particular the low-lying areas. In terms of the required storage and drainage capacity, the water assignment for Hoboken is calculated. This technical assignment provides a rough measure of the required delay and storage capacity in urban areas for given rain events that exceed the existing storage and pumping capacity. With a basic hydrological model, the storage is determined on the basis of 100 years of precipitation data. The water assignment isn’t normative. It does not take detailed area characteristics, elevation profile and sewer layout into account and therefore cannot determine the locations where flooding occurs. With statistics afterwards, the storage volumes for 1, 2, 10 and 50 years design storms is determined. The table below shows the water assignment for these storm events. The volumes of water in the water assignment show the pressure on the current drainage system. During a T1 storm event, the required storage capacity is already twice the available sewer storage of 8.3 MG. For a T10 the excessive volume is 40.9 MG, corresponding to 62 Olympic swimming pools spread over the city. Based on the current storage capacity of 0.5 inch/day, SDF curves show that for a T10 storm, a pumping capacity of more than 15 inch per day would be needed. Due to interconnections, the calculated volumes per sub basin may differ from the actual volumes. Future regulations may require the North Hudson Sewerage Authority (NHSA), to reduce the flooding frequency on average once every 4 years or a T4 return period (HobokenNJ, 2013). The preferred T10 drainage capacity (5.0 inch in 24h) as set out in the US urban drainage design manual even corresponds with a required T10 storage capacity. A number of blue-green adaptation measures have been selected for Hoboken based on site suitability. The six-layer approach, which integrates urban planning and subsoil characteristics, gives an overview of the opportunities and constraints for blue and green measures in the area. Well-fitting measures appeared to be subsurface detention storage in the higher elevated areas, storm water flow-through planters, (storm water infiltration) trees and permeable pavement in infrastructure. In public space, parks, water squares, green squares, detention below sports fields, open water and urban farming would fit well. The buildings in Hoboken found to be suitable for rainwater harvest tanks, blue- and green roofs, green facades and urban farming on rooftops. To maximize blue-green benefits, a citywide network of waterways, green areas, green streets and common gardens is proposed. Five design strategies were developed with combinations of blue-green measures, applied to different layers in the urban system. The first (1) design strategy improves the current situation with the application of subsurface adaptation measures. With a functional analysis, storage possibilities beneath parking lots and sports fields are determined. Two deep storage basins will are proposed. The remaining sports fields and parking lots will be equipped with shallow storage facilities. The second (2) design strategy improves the current situation with the application of infrastructural adaptation measures. This includes surface measures like permeable pavement, storm water infiltration planters and trees along major roads, and green in the streetscape. The third (3) design strategy applies adaptation measures on public space. Undeveloped public areas suitable to rain gardens, storm water trees and flow-through planters, water squares, detention below sport fields, parks, retention ponds (in new/existing green space), urban agriculture, bio retention swales, rainwater harvest cistern and seasonal storage are here for identified. For the fourth (4) design scenario, adaptation measures were applied on private space and buildings. Buildings suitable to place green roofs in the area are analysed. The fifth (5) strategy in the end, combines the proposed measures into an urban blue-green metabolism. Additional green is applied to the public space. Hollow roads discharge storm water towards open water bodies and green in the streetscape connects green area and open water in the city centre to green belt. The mitigation performance of every design strategy regarding the water assignment is tested on the basis of a Storm Water Management Model (SWMM). The five design scenarios were added to the basic model by Low Impact Development controls (i.e. green roofs, permeable pavement, bio swales). To quantify the contribution of the design strategies to the water assignment, a number of criteria and parameters are identified. The criteria for design performance are (a) flood volume reduction during heavy rainfall events, (b) CSO reduction, (c) vulnerability reduction of critical public buildings and infrastructure (f.e. Hoboken terminal, hospitals, wastewater treatment plant, electricity distribution locations), and (d) improvement the urban quality of living. Four parameters to evaluate the to evaluate the contribution to flood mitigation and overflow reduction are (1) the flood volume in the drainage area (internal outflow), (2) the runoff per sub-basin, (3) the total storm water storage per sub-basin (excluding sewer storage), (4) critical facilities threatened by flash floods. All strategies showed contribution to flood volume reduction and creating urban quality, but not all strategies were as effective. Strategy 1 can store about 10% of the total flood volume. It has the least contribution to urban quality, since only subsurface storage, and no vegetated measures were used. Strategy 2 on the other hand, has a very broad effect on the green experience of the city. It includes the greening of three major roads. Strategy 3 uses undeveloped space to create a green network throughout the city. It has the least effect on total flood reduction of all strategies, but uses space that would otherwise lie fallow. In strategy 4, green roofs are applied on all suitable buildings throughout the city. This had a positive effect on both flood reduction, reduction of the urban heat island effect, and air quality. When the roofs are large enough, they can even function as a roof garden, roof restaurant or private kitchen garden. Design strategy 5, the city-wide metabolism and people design strategy, combines all design strategies into a citywide system of blue-green measures. Modelling showed that Hoboken benefits most from this city-wide design strategy (5) in terms of quantitative flood reduction. This design strategy also has the most additional green through a citywide network of vegetated measures. The proposed spatial typology of the city-wide metabolism and people design strategy is elaborated with a number of illustrations. Green roofs, permeable pavement, bio-retention gardens, storage basins, an urban farm, urban wetlands and water squares are included in the adaptation design. Through the urban grid system, vegetated areas are connected to create a pleasant experience throughout the city. The riverbeds in the east and the areas at the bottom of the cliff are surrounding the city with a green belt. The green belt along the cliffs serves for both storage and infiltration of water. The three major roads with trees and plants create green veins through the heart of the city. In every part between the major roads parks, urban farms or wetlands can be found. A solid footpath or bicycle lane can be applied along the city borders to create an uninterrupted route. This citywide system of flood prevention measures provides a pleasant, physical appearance. Recommendations For future work, a number of suggestions can be presented towards the reliability and effectiveness of this study. To fill up data gaps in the current model, a follow up study regarding the costs and support of the proposed design is meaningful. The suggested design strategy 5 is the most extensive urban design is the most extensive one and therefor also the most costly. Historical research on blue-green measures resulted in implementation costs indications. These results need to be revised for the proposed design and with up to date financial taxes. Support for the design is needed when it comes to realisation. Inhabitants, businesses, landowners, the NJ transit and the governance are important stakeholders. Based on the outcome of this research, the improvement of the storm water management model is of biggest interest.","urban water managment; blue-green measures; urban planning; SWMM; flash floods","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Water Management","","Water Resources Management","",""

In addition to being expensive the last mile frequently runs through urban areas and contributes to local pollution and congestion. One possible method to increase efficiency in the last mile, whilst keeping pollution and emissions low, is the Urban Consolidation Centre. In spite of the high number of projects started, there is still relatively little known on what value this concept can generate. The objective of this study is to explore the potential sectors in which the UCC can add value and how much value is actually created. We found that the construction sector can be a suitable sector for the UCC to pursue, although it necessary to do more research to determine how much value this sector can generate. The waste sector has some potential, but also has some drawbacks on suitability of waste ows for consolidation and legislation. The actual value of two cases, shipper and carrier, were studied and shows a last-mile savings between e7 and e8 per stop consolidated for most scenarios. The network effects increase this value to e12,65 for the shipper when 35 cities are included. For the carrier this value is only increased to e8,42 when 35 cities are included. These results provide the necessary basis for an accurate business model to be further developed and tested. The network effects were not previously reported and therefore add significantly to the value proposition of the UCC's business model.","UCC; last-mile; logistics; consolidation; value; VRP","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Technology, Policy and Management","Transport, Infrastructure and Logistics","","Management of Technology","",""

(mentor); Taale, H. (mentor); Mak, W.J. (mentor); Witteveen, C. (mentor); Wiggenraad, P.B.L. (mentor)","2015","Congestion on the road is a widely recognized problem. To improve traffic conditions on the road, several methods have been developed over the years. Dynamic traffic management is one of them and has proven to be effective. It aims at making better use of the existing network capacity and at managing traffic flows. In order to further improve the effectiveness of the individual measures, research into coordination of individual traffic management measures (i.e. integrated network management) has recently been increased. Effectiveness can be improved since (i) the counteracting of measures against each other can be reduced and (ii) the strengths of the individual measures can be combined. To show the benefits of integrated network management in a real world situation, a well performed field operational test is needed. In the Netherlands this was a reason to launch the Field Operational Test Integrated Network Management Amsterdam, in Dutch the Praktijkproef Amsterdam. Part of the Praktijkproef Amsterdam was the development of a controller that can control bottleneck situations which occur in the neighbourhood of a junction of a freeway and an urban arterial. Bottleneck situations that can occur are: (i) spillback on the urban arterial causing blocking back on the urban arterial, (ii) spillback from the off-ramp towards the freeway causing congestion on the freeway, (iii) spillback from the on-ramp towards the urban arterial causing blocking back on the urban arterial. These three situations capture all possible bottleneck situations that can occur in this type of network. In the Praktijkproef Amsterdam a certain controller was developed which can only handle the third situation. Therefore, in this research a controller is developed that is able to control all three situations. Hence, the objective of this research is a controller that deals with bottleneck situations occurring in the neighbourhood of a junction of a freeway and an urban arterial; in order to reach its goals, the controller should distribute traffic over the available buffer space in the network, by using traffic lights at controlled intersections. In the first situation the bottleneck needs to be detected and controlled (detection is input for control), in the second and third situation the queue at the ramp needs to be controlled. The research consists of three phases: (i) a literature survey that studies the state-of-the-art related to the controller to be developed, (ii) the development and programming (in MATLAB) of different controller variants and (iii) the simulation (in VISSIM) of the variants. The literature survey showed that controllers that are capable of controlling the three bottleneck situations mentioned, do not exist at the moment. Several controller variants are developed to distribute traffic over the buffers in one of the bottleneck situations. Distribution is based on changing the signal settings of the traffic lights: an increase in green time results in a decrease in queue length, and vice versa. Signal settings are changed based on calculated desired flows for the buffers. For the first situation three detection variants are developed: detection based on (i) a crisp critical queue length value, (ii) differences in queue lengths between two time periods, (iii) fuzzy logic with queue lengths and flows as input values. Furthermore three controller variants are developed: controllers that distribute the surplus of traffic over (i) one up- or downstream buffer based on prespecified preferences of using up- or downstream buffers, (ii) one up- or three downstream buffers also based on these prespecified preferences of using up- or downstream buffers, (iii) one up- and one downstream buffer based on relative buffer space. For the second situation the queue at the off-ramp is managed by increasing the outflow at the ramp, based on a target outflow. Due to this increase spillback should be prevented. Two controller variants are developed: a controller which increases the outflow by distributing traffic over (i) the first downstream buffer, (ii) three downstream buffers based on turn fractions. For the third situation the queue at the on-ramp is managed by reducing the inflow into the ramp, based on a target inflow. This should lead to the prevention of spillback at the ramp. Three controller variants are developed: controllers that reduce the inflow by distribution traffic over the (i) first upstream buffer, (ii) three upstream buffers based on turn fractions, (iii) three upstream buffers based on relative queue lengths. The ST1Light (developed in the Praktijkproef Amsterdam) is the fourth variant in this bottleneck situation, the ST1Light calculates the amount of buffers needed to reach the target inflow. In the first situation congestion on the urban arterial is reduced by preventing spillback. A fuzzy logic approach using flow and queue length as inputs in order to detect bottleneck situations, shows best results in combination with the controllers: the smooth approach of the fuzzy detection results in more smooth control actions and therefore less variation in queue lengths at the bottleneck. The controller that prefers to use downstream buffers shows largest improvements in network performance (-3.3% in total travel time). The controller that uses both up- and downstream buffers has the strongest effect on reducing the queue at the bottleneck situation, but due to the upstream buffering total travel time increases (+1.7% in total travel time). In the second situation congestion at the freeway is prevented, by preventing spillback from the ramp towards the freeway. Both designed controllers prevent spillback towards the freeway, hence preventing congestion and the capacity drop at the freeway. There is no trade-off shown at the urban arterial. This results in large improvements in the overall network performance. If more downstream buffers are used, the traffic is flushed further into the network and it reaches the network boundaries faster, hence resulting in shorter travel times and larger improvements in overall network performance (-38.7% in total travel time). In the third situation spillback from the on-ramp towards the urban arterial is prevented by the developed controllers. If more buffer capacity is used, the network performance shows larger reductions due to the buffering of traffic. Therefore the controller which only uses the first upstream buffers, shows best results in network performance (-1.1% in total travel time). If no control is used, the network performance is better (-3.8% in total travel time), but in that case spillback from the on-ramp is not prevented. If no spillback occurs, the metering time of ramp metering installations will increase and traffic safety in the network will improve since the conflict area at the urban arterial of the on-ramp intersection is not occupied anymore. It can be concluded that if buffers downstream of the bottleneck can be used, the controllers show positive results regarding the network performance; and if buffers upstream are used, delays for traffic upstream of the bottleneck increase. The latter results in a decrease in network performance. First of all it is recommended to implement bottleneck detection on urban arterials, based on a fuzzy logic approach. Bottleneck detection is not a part of current intersection control systems, and can be added to those systems. In order to control the bottleneck situations, the developed controller that prefers to use downstream buffers can be coupled to a current control system. Secondly it is recommended to prevent spillback at the off-ramp by setting a target outflow. The controller that only uses the first downstream buffer can be combined with current active systems. Thirdly it is recommended to prevent spillback at the on-ramp by setting a target inflow. It is recommended to use the first and second upstream buffers to buffer traffic. Furthermore it is recommended to switch off the controller if spillback occurs to conflict areas of the intersections, since the latter leads to large increases in travel times at the urban arterial. Future research should focus on further tuning (e.g. fuzzy parameters) and testing (e.g. different traffic conditions, increased network size) of the control algorithms, and on combining the controller with current used systems in the field. Furthermore a supervisor could be created that can deal with multiple active bottleneck situations.","integrated network management; traffic distribution; buffer space; controlled intersections; spillback prevention","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Transport & Planning","","Transport and Planning","",""

(mentor); Zijlstra, J.J.M. (mentor)","2015","This report presents the results of the design of dynamic bicycle path lighting using a circular design approach for the company Lightwell. In the next decade, 600 million Euros will be invested in the construction of ‘bicycle’ highways, in order to stimulate commuting by bicycle. As no specialized bicycle path lighting is currently available, a potential business opportunity arises.The proposed design: Hyperion, offers an unique cycling experience and has been designed to fit in an update system to benefit from future developments in LED technology. A sub goal of this project is to explore the main issues and benefits of using a circular design approach in a small company and how the delft design methods fit within circular development. Setting the Context A context was created using literature studies and multiple input sessions and questionnaires attended by municipality functionaries. Current bicycle path lighting is often based on research performed on the visual task of motorists, resulting in a misunderstanding of the driving tasks of cyclists. Casting light on the path and the edges of the path (near periphery) is essential for safe cycling, whilst casting light in the far periphery will result in an increased feeling of social safety. Using different light colors, the vision in these field can be optimized whilst keeping the lighting levels low. In order to create circular products, a system in which parts or materials can loop has to be designed. It is already widely known that the fast efficiency development of LED lighting will provide circular opportunities. Using a dynamic model the environmental impact of the optimal replacement scenario of a street light was calculated, indicating that optimal replacement is best performed every 8 years instead of the current lifespan of 20 years. A system is created in which the light engine can easily be upgraded to prolong the lifetime of the entire product. Financial model is used to calculated the viability of this system in real valuate. This construction proves to be budget neutral within 4 years after the first update. Extensive analysis, based on the Circular toolkit by the University of Cambridge formed the basis for the circular requirements of the concept. Hyperion Hyperion consist of 3 products; an innovative bollard, a ‘normal’ fixture and an integrated detection sensor. The fixture and sensor are installed on junctions or areas that requires more light in the periphery due to social safety. In between these sections, special bollards are placed, casting light onto the path and near periphery. This enables more ease of access, reduces the maintenance costs and costs for light engine updates. Furthermore, it offers a new cycling experience through smart dimming and could theoretically result in better facial recognition whilst evoking no false sense of social safety. A lease system will be enabled by a middle-man as the financial risk is it too high for a small business such as Lightwell. In order to get more insights into the circular design in the full development process, the bollard is fully embodied. Circular Design Designing for a circular economy can not solely be done on product level, but requires knowledge on system level and deep technical knowledge of a system/ product architecture. It was concluded that the current design methods taught at Delft offer little room for circularity in a ‘normal’ design assignment. A product to redesign, or ideas for a (new) system should be available from the beginning. As a product is needed to fully define the system this becomes a chicken or egg situation in radical product development.","lighting; Circular Economy; CE; bicycle; street light; design","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Design Engineering","","Master of Science Integrated Product Design","",""

(mentor)","2015","In the manufacturing process of flat panel displays (FPD), such as the making of the photomasks and the lithographic process of the glass substrates, the demand for a larger but thinner substrate is increasing. Consequently, the moving stage of these manufacturing machines become larger in size and heavier in weight. The high velocity and acceleration specifications for positioning a moving stage of several tons will require much more power and higher power rate output than any usual positioning tasks. One solution to eliminate the moving mass of the stage is to use a contactless stage. A contactless positioning stage which is capable of controlling a 100 mm wafer in three in-plane degrees of freedom has been developed successfully in the Mechatronic System Design group of the Precision and Microsystems Department. The deployed controller on the contactless stage is a decoupled three-loop Single Input Single Output (SISO) cascaded controller designed by classical loop shaping methods. An initial study shows that the in-plane rotational DoF is disturbed when the center of mass of the wafer is moved from the center of the concatenated air actuators and the planar translational axes are accelerating or decelerating. In addition, the power spectral densities of the measured pressure signals indicate that a high power pressure disturbance affects each control pressure channel. Therefore, the contactless positioning stage should be treated as a Multi Input Multi Output (MIMO) system and controlled with control schemes tailored to the wafer dynamics and the spectrum of disturbances as a potential alternative positioning mechanism at nano/micro levels. In this thesis, the goal is to develop a three in-plane degrees of freedom, multivariable model of the contactless stage, and identify its dynamics or estimate its parameters. With a determined control configuration, design and develop control schemes on the contactless stage that achieves a positioning specification with sub-micrometer precision when performing positioning tasks similar to an industrial precision positioning stage used in FPD manufacturing. With a cascaded control scheme, the dynamics of the contactless stage consist of pressure dynamics and wafer dynamics. The pressure dynamics of the air channels are identified by the Closed-loop Multivariable Output Error Subspace (CL-MOESP) algorithm first. Then the wafer dynamics are modeled from the Newton-Euler equations and the model parameters with disturbance forces in plane are estimated with an extended Kalman filter. Both dynamic models are validated by the comparisons of the frequency response functions (FRFs) of the derived models with the measured FRFs of the system. The pressure and position control problems are formulated with the required performance specifications. Then, both the pressure and position controller are synthesized using pole placement with sensitivity function shaping techniques. With high bandwidth inner pressure loops, a MIMO triangular controller is designed to control the positions and rotation of the wafer in plane. Moreover, a repetitive control scheme is adopted to enhance the tracking performance of the translational DoFs.

(mentor); Kleinsmann, M.S. (mentor)","2015","This master thesis is the final documentation of the graduation project “Laatiepleinzijn: Design for liveability” assigned by the Laatiepleinzijn initiative and the Faculty of Industrial Design Engineering, Delft University of Technology. It describes the design of a product-service system that enables inhabitants to improve local liveability. The project started with a context analysis and formulation of a design vision and continued with a series of iterations that led to the final concept which was evaluated by the stakeholders. The context in which the project took place is the Burgermeester Meineszplein in Delfshaven, Rotterdam. Three initiators of the Laatiepleinzijn initiative wish to improve the liveability of the square with the support of the neighbourhood. Area networkers, civil servants and external professionals were invited to be involved in the process. The objective of the project was stated as follows: “To design a product-service system that connects organisations and inhabitants at the Burgermeester Meineszplein, in order to improve the liveability on the square.” The project was divided in three phases: ideate, iterate and demonstrate. In all phases Design and Research Explorations (D&REs) were performed to discover and refine the desired interactions between the stakeholders. The ideate phase commenced with literature research and resulted in the hypothesis that liveability can be improved by means of initiative building. Both the social and the safety/physical components of liveability can be improved when locals come together to improve their neighbourhood. Visits to existing initiatives in Delfshaven showed that inhabitants tend to live in their own bubble; they are unaware of what is available in their area and focus on local activities based on personal interest. On top of this, the recent transitions in local governance have blurred the connections between inhabitants and the (local) municipality. A series of creative workshops were organised to support the inhabitants of the Burgermeester Meineszplein in determining their ambitions. Exercises in creative facilitation were performed with the help of facilitators and prepared templates. These creative workshops were a refreshing interpretation of the traditional neighbourhood gatherings. Insights gained during the workshops resulted in a series of exercises, roles and templates that make up an initiative building toolkit. These tools make up the service layer of the design (figure 1). The iterate phase focused on the communication of these tools. Several ideas were conceptualised, including a physical D.I.Y. box and an online game. The final design took shape of an online platform. This is the product layer of the design. On this online platform, initiators are invited to create a page for their initiative and upload their progress online. In this way a database arises that communicates the objectives, progress and members of initiatives within a certain area. Area networkers, members of the area committee, commercial professionals and clusters of the citywide municipality can use the platform to acquire an overview of local participation. During the initiative building process various touchpoints bring the stakeholders together. In this way, the system connects the stakeholders and makes it possible to share knowledge and skills. In the demonstrate phase evaluative interviews were performed. Here it came forward that the initiative building toolkit can help initiatives to organise their ambitions. Area networkers and members of the area committee see the online platform as an aid of their daily activities. When initiatives share their ideas and progress online, it becomes easier for distributors of participatory budget (e.g. the area networker and/or committee and Opzoomer Mee) to assess appeals for funding. At the same time, initiatives take themselves more seriously when they document their process.","liveability; service design; social design; product-service system","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Industrial Design","","Master of Science Design for Interaction","",""

(mentor); Thomassen, E.W. (mentor)","2015","The goal of the project was to design a mechanical watch that provides a new direction for the current product portfolio of Pellikaan Timing. This was achieved by analysing the meaning of the mechanical watch for the consumer. From a context mapping session could be concluded that the mechanical watch is a very personal product. The owner connects heavily with the watch as well as with the corrosponding company. A number of ideas were created that would give the watch a competitive advantage through a functional innovation. The inspiration for these ideas was taken from characteristics of the mechanical watch industry and observations made from watch enthusiasts. The concept of a modular watch proved to have the most potential. Aside from the functionality, different options for the aeshetics were explored as well. At multiple stages of the project, prototypes were built to support the decision making process. These prototypes lead to the conclusion to only incorporate the modularity of the watch in the bezel. The prototypes simultaniously also served as a proof of concept for possible investers. The final engineering phase of the project resulted in the Pellikaan Timing Stingray. A watch with a diameter of 45 millimeters. The bezel of the watch can be replaced easily through a simple sliding button on the side of the case. The Stingray is an accurate representation of the company owner’s vision on watch design. Additionally, the watch provides a lot of opportunity to advertise the company’s new core values. Not only in terms of design and technology, but also in terms of service. The Stingray will be launched with the help of a small group of investers. The investers are attracted using a promotional video that was made of the Stingray.","Pellikaan; timing; modular; mechanical; watch","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Industrial Design","","Master of Science Integrated Product Design","",""

A discrepancy was found between the amount of orders placed and handled every day possibly resulting in late orders and increased cost. To reduce this discrepancy a simulation model was created to test the impact of different planning decisions on the performance. By experimenting with different forecasting models, the forecasting accuracy was greatly increased. However, the effect on the amount of late orders was minimal. Other planning parameters that were researched were the schedule resulting from the forecast, the starting time s and the maximal shift duration d. From these parameters, starting time s turned out to have the greatest impact. By changing the planning either late orders can be reduced from 33% to 13% of total handled orders or cost could be reduced by 9%.

The aim of this graduation is to design money. A positive impact on the environmental is made with the design of a so called community currency. In the economy we stumble upon limits which the market cannot easily solve by itself. Community currencies are made in addition to legal tender (e.g. Euros or Dollars) with the aim to satisfy needs that are not facilitated by regular money. Advancements in information technology make it easier than ever to introduce and maintain such initiatives. The final concept of this graduation is Around the Corner; a holiday booking platform that stimulates users to go on holiday nearby. This makes a significant impact on reducing emissions, because the trip is almost half of the holiday’s footprint. If users stay nearby home, they get rewarded a community currency called Locals, which they receive after booking. Locals can pay for another holiday, sent to a friend or used for services at the accommodation. In addition part of the Locals are invested by the accommodations to compensate for travelling emissions. So far green holiday labels don’t take into account the emissions of the journey. With its transaction technology Around the Corner is extremely scalable, it removes initial investments for accommodations and offers self-help payment technology.

(mentor); Goossens, R. (mentor)","2015","This report gives an overview of the followed process, findings and results of the graduation project: Design of biopsy supporting container for a new snap freezing procedure. The project is a collaboration between the IDE faculty of TU Delft and the company PamGene. Carried out by an IPD master student with a Medisign specialization. Literature research The starting point of the assignment concerns the exploration of biopsy acquisition, processing and sectioning for diagnosis. Through the literature study it became apparent that biopsy specimens are taken for a variety of reasons but one of the main reasons to collect a biopsy specimen is to check for cancer and if so if the tissue is benign or malignant. From the study done it was noticed that there is a variety in medical equipment to collect a biopsy specimen, ranging from specialized needles up to the regular scalpel. Next to that there are different ways to obtain and process tissue, which may differ from hospital to hospital. During the literature research special focus was given to the core biopsy needles. This type of instrument is commonly used for almost the whole body to obtain a biopsy specimen. Core biopsy needles are considered minimal invasive instruments, which mean that the damage done to the patient’s body is kept a low a possible. Minimal invasive procedures have several advantages over regular surgical procedures due to the shortened hospital stay, accelerated rehabilitation, small incision, less blood loss and a reduction in scar tissue. Depending on the type of diagnosis, tissue is fixated with formalin or transported fresh to the pathology laboratory. At the pathology laboratory, most of the tissue is processed further by embedding it in paraffin and a smaller amount is fresh frozen. From the literature it became apparent that multiple medical professionals with different backgrounds and functions work together to get the tissue specimens out of the body up to the diagnosis of the tissue. However there is little information available regarding the exact actions that are performed by medical specialists. The same applies to information on the best freezing methods and temperatures for different types of tissues. Field research Next to the literature study a field research has been performed to observe the currently used workflows and to indicate tasks of the different medical professionals. Furthermore other aspects like the instrument and biopsy handling, communication between departments and of course problems experienced by the medical professionals themselves where not found yet. Therefore it was important to observe several biopsy acquisition and processing procedures. The ErasmusMC hospital in Rotterdam was used as a starting point for the field research. ErasmusMC was used as a starting point because it is one of the eight UMC’s in the Netherlands, which means it is one of the more specialized hospitals. From thereon two different regular hospitals were visited to get a better general picture of the complete workflow. A total of 12 biopsy acquisitions (7 needle/5 forceps) and multiple processing procedures have been observed. During the observations questions were asked add the medical staff to get answers to ambiguities or why certain actions were performed. The following hospitals have been visited during the project: ErasmusMC in Rotterdam, SFG in Rotterdam and RdGG in Delft. The field trips showed multiple points during the complete process from acquisition up to the sectioning that could be improved. The tissue handling can be improved and gain in time can be achieved. It also became apparent that each department has a lot of knowledge about what they do, but as soon as the tissue is transported to the next department is they don’t know what happens to it. During the observations it was also noticed that not all protocols are followed properly by some medical professionals. Vision Based on the literature study and the field research four different design directions were developed. 1 Collect tissue from needle and process through FFPE. (Not really assignment related) 2 Collect tissue from needle and process through current freezing methods 3 Collect tissue from needle and process through new freezing methods (original assignment) 4 Collect tissue from needle and process through FFPE or freezing The design directions are based on the different acquisition and processing techniques. Main focus for the continuation of the project goes to the acquisition, collection and sectioning of fresh tissue specimens, however to increase the market potential FFPE specimens are also considered during the next phase. The future product should reduce the amount of tissue pickups and reduce the laborious freezing procedure. The developed design directions are used as idea generation inputs. Concept design Various idea generation techniques were used in combination with the design directions in order to find solutions for the found problems and opportunities. For each design direction multiple ideas were developed. Due to the relatively extreme conditions of the project (very small pieces of tissue, extremely low temperatures) different prototypes were quickly developed to actually test the ideas. Through trial and error, the most valuable ideas were selected. This was one of the few ways to actually find out if an idea would work. Based on two design directions three different concepts were developed with different working principles. (shape memory materials - tongue stuck to frozen pole - create a larger surface tension) For each concept a prototype was made and evaluated by a veterinarian student and the supervisory team, in order to find the most promising concept. Based on the prototyping test results and the experiences of the supervisory team the PamBrane concept was selected for embodiment. Embodiment design PamBrane is a concept that enables quick and easy transfer of biopsy specimens out of the core biopsy needle to the product. Biopsies adhere to the membrane by creating a larger surface tension between the membrane and the tissue, than the surface tension that is present between the needle and the biopsy specimen. Instead of shaking the biopsy specimen of the needle, with all the related problems, the biopsy can be transferred by just slightly pushing it against the membrane. Once arrived at the pathology laboratory the PamBrane is frozen in liquid nitrogen or already frozen in a future scenario. After freezing the PamBrane is snapped into a special specimen disc and the tissue is ready for cutting. One of the main goals of the embodiment phase was to develop and test a prototype based on the working principles of the PamBrane concept. Based on the observed workflows a future workflow was developed for the PamBrane. By combining the workflow and working principles a final prototype was made and tested in a medical environment by medical professionals. During the evaluation study the PamBrane prototype proofed that the main goals of the project were met. Next to that the PamBrane also looks promising in reducing the logistics and the amount of actions that should be performed by the users. Future scope The project ends with recommendations for further development of the PamBrane. The main focus during the project was to develop a special container that can be used for the acquisition and snap freezing, but halfway through the project this scope was adjusted also to incorporate FFPE based biopsies. The working principles of the PamBrane are suitable for both the snap freezing and FFPE process. However some final adjustments and optimization are needed for the PamBrane system. The evaluation showed that the PamBrane creates value for PamGene to develop a new biopsy processing workflow based on new snap freezing procedures. With a few adjustments the PamBrane can also be made suitable for the broader used FFPE process.","medical; biopsy; cryogenic; snap freeze; tissue","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Industrial Design","","Master specialisation Medisign","","52.001707, 4.369953"

Optimization of the cargo handling system is needed to control the relative horizontal motions. This study investigates whether the mooring device ShoreTension will minimize the relative horizontal motions between a HTV and a cargo, when it is used as the cargo handling system during offshore loading and discharge operations. A MATLAB function of ShoreTension is developed, which is implemented into AQWA to predict the relative horizontal motions between the HTV and the cargo in time. Multiple simulations have been performed, each with its own cargo handling system. A simplified MATLAB mass-spring-ShoreTension model resembling the HTV and the cargo is set up to determine why and when ShoreTension reduces motions. A cargo handling system including ShoreTension cannot reduce the high-, wave-frequent relative horizontal motions occurring between the HTV and the cargo, as they are induced by an excitation frequency far beyond the natural frequency of the original system. Furthermore, a cargo handling system including ShoreTension should be able to lower the low-frequent relative horizontal motions, which are the result of resonance; by increasing the stiffness and by adding damping through giving out and heaving in the mooring line. The optimal configuration has not yet been found. It is recommended to further investigate in how ShoreTension should be outfitted as cargo handling system such that the low-frequent relative horizontal motions are minimized.","Dockwise; Heavy Transport Vessel (HTV); Offshore loading and discharge; Relative horizontal motions; Cargo handling system; ShoreTension","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Marine & Transport Technology","","Offshore and Dredging Engineering","",""

The Scyllias, the result of this graduation project, is the answer to still have an amazing immersive underwater experience but in an approachable way. This master thesis shows the process and results of designing the Scyllias. The process is divided in three phases: the analysis phase, the ideation and conceptualisation phase and the elaboration and embodiment phase. The analysis phase the background of the context and the problem are being examined. This was done by means of interviews, literature study and internet research. The conclusion of this phase resulted in the design vision with design goal ""Design of a luxurious semi-submersible that provides an easy accessible and immersive underwater experience."" In the ideation and conceptualisation phase ideas for solutions to the problem were generated. First the problem of the transformation, submerging from above to below the water surface, was tackled. When this was done ideas for the inside of the pod were generated. Phase three was the elaboration and embodiment phase. The result is a detailed concept as a design proposal. The design is not optimized and many things are still to be developed. The dimensioning of the pod was tested by means of a mock up. The conclusion is that the Scyllias is a realistic solution to the design goal. Above the water the design of the Scyllias, both technical as aesthetically, meet the requirement of being conspicuous. The pod is easy accessible and when submerged will give the user a truly unique immersive underwater experience.","underwater; experience; semi-submersible; catamaran; luxury","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Industrial Design","","Master of Science Integrated Product Design","",""

(mentor)","2015","Since the beginning of the century the field of airborne wind energy has emerged to provide with new means of generating renewable energy. It's ability to access higher altitudes and it's relatively low material requirements with respect to conventional wind turbines, have inspired several research institutes and commercial parties to invest significantly in this novel technology. In the development of pumping cycle based airborne wind energy systems, the usage of kites has been a popular choice. The kite is used to generate a traction force on its tether. This enables the tether to be reeled off of a drum on the ground station, which drives a generator. This way electricity is generated. When the maximum altitude is reached, the kite is depowered and reeled back in. This cycle has a net energy gain because the invested energy during reel in is lower than the generated energy during reel out. In order to improve the efficiency and controllability of the kite, it's design needs to be optimized for power generation. These days, kite designs originate from kite-surfing or paragliding where safety is the driving requirement. Therefore it is expected that a redesign for energy generation will yield an improved efficiency of the kite power system. In order to perform this redesign, the flight behaviour of the kite needs to be investigated. This research project builds on previously existing work in an effort to develop a fluid-structure interactions model that is able to simulate the behaviour of the kite in flight. As this is a very complex task, the analysis tool that is developed in this project is focussed on the local deformation behaviour of this wing when it is suspended in an air flow. To this end, the kite structure is simplified to a cantilevered wing. The tool is able to capture both the dynamic and the static nonlinear aeroelastic behaviour of the wing. As this nonlinear aeroelastic behaviour is a very complex and time consuming problem to solve, the algorithm used separates this model from the dynamic simulation. A linear simulation is used to simulate the wing's in-flight behaviour. At discrete intervals this linear simulation is corrected using a nonlinear aeroelastic model. This leads to an accurate description of the dynamic behaviour of the kite. For the structural modelling of the wing, a finite element solver that uses triangular shell elements to describe the wing structure is used. It allows for application of different aerodynamic load models. With this project a thorough revision of the existing code base has lead to a more accessible and usable piece of software for the aeroelastic solver routine. This was extended with a dynamic linear solver and an intricate coupling routine. It provides with a good backbone for further research into fluid-structure interactions for kite or other flexible membrane wings because of the modular design philosophy.","Windenergy; Fluid-structure interactions; Kite Power; Airborne Wind Energy","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","Aerospace Design, Integration & Operations","","","",""

(mentor)","2015","In this thesis both Wake Ingestion (WI) and Boundary Layer Ingestion (BLI) configurations have been investigated and analyzed with respect to their application to aircraft design. WI and BLI in the context used here means positioning the engine such that it ingests boundary layer fluid for the purpose of saving shaft-power. This research compares propulsors in free-stream, WI and BLI configurations for their shaft-power savings. The power elements present in these configurations are identified theoretically using the Power Balance Method (PBM) and quantified experimentally by using Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV). Also, these different configurations are compared using non-dimensional parameters such as thrust-power coefficient and propeller efficiency. This is accomplished by integrating different instruments able to capture the relevant physical phenomena such as thrust, torque and Rotations Per Minute (RPM). These measurements are conducted in the low-speed wind-tunnel facility of Delft University of Technology. The aim is to experimentally quantify the increase in propeller efficiency for WI and BLI configurations. In order to properly compare the three configurations, these are tested in two different wind-tunnel conditions; ’equilibrium’ and ’constant-speed’. In the equilibrium case, propulsor thrust is set identical to body drag for varying wind-speeds whereas the constant-speed case requires the wind-speed to be fixed and propulsor thrust to vary. The main finding is that a propulsor in WI configuration saves 9% shaft-power w.r.t. an identical propulsor in free-stream configuration under identical net-force conditions. This power saving is more prominently present in BLI configuration where 18% power saving is measured. This measured power saving is due to the fact that the propulsor is immersed in the slower moving wake. The propulsive efficiency, which is different from propeller efficiency, can generate values that exceed 100% in WI and BLI configurations. Therefore, a different definition of efficiency for a wake ingested propulsor is introduced. Using this new definition, the propulsive efficiency does not exceed unity for perfect wake filling configurations. The PIV analysis on the identified power terms shows that a limited amount of wake power is available for performance enhancement. The analysis also showed that pressure plays a significant role in these tightly integrated configurations which cannot be ignored. This insight can be used for the development of WI and BLI applications. These applications are needed as a mean to reduce fuel consumption for future aircraft.","Boundary Layer Ingestion; efficiency; propeller; wake ingestion; Particle Image Velocimetry","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","Flight Performance and Propulsion","","","",""

(mentor)","2015","Cross-laminated timber, or CLT, is currently receiving attention for its potential use in tall building structures. Timber being a combustible material, one of the main challenges for the construction of these buildings is the potential fire risk that results from its use in the structure. For tall buildings, there is an increased severity of the consequences of structural failure as result of a fire. In order to obtain the desired level of safety, building codes typically require tall buildings to have a high fire resistance rating. The Eurocode recognises the risk associated with failure of the high rise structure and indicates that it is to be designed according to consequences class 3: failure of the structure due to fire is highly undesirable and the structure needs to be reliably safe and robust. The design of tall buildings in consequence class 3 requires a high degree of insight into their structural fire behaviour. An in-depth investigation is needed of risks associated with the fire behaviour, and the structural fire response. In this research the effect of using the combustible material CLT as the main bearing structure is investigated. As a combustible material, unprotected CLT can burn along with the fuel load present in a compartment. Irrespective of its fire resistance rating, it is uncertain whether the structure will be totally consumed in the event of a fire. This can result in collapse of the structure. It is important to understand whether the timber structure continues burning or whether a fire would decay by self-extinguishment, possibly in combination with active fire safety measures such as sprinkler activation or fire-brigade intervention. However, self-extinguishment currently is not part of fire safety considerations for the structural design of tall timber buildings. This master’s thesis aims to increase insight into the fire behaviour of unprotected CLT structures in a compartment burnout, conservatively assuming no active measures. The main research question of this work is: “Under what conditions is there a potential for self-extinguishment of cross-laminated timber?” A model of self-extinguishment of CLT was created which consists of various phases of a compartment burnout. Under the influence of an initial fire due to burning of room contents, the exposed CLT becomes involved in flaming combustion. Once the room contents have been largely consumed and the initial fire decays, the CLT contribution is expected to decrease as well, transforming from flaming to smouldering combustion. Finally, there will be a transition from smouldering to self-extinguishment. Two series of experiments were conducted to investigate this model and the conditions under which the transitions can take place. The first series of experiments investigated two conditions at which the CLT can transform from smouldering to self-extinguishment: heat flux on the CLT and the airflow over its surface. This was done by exposing CLT to various heat fluxes and airflows in a cone calorimeter. It was found that smouldering CLT self-extinguishes when the externally applied flux is below 5 to 6 kW/m2. The additional airflow was also found to be of influence. At a heat flux of 6 kW/m2, an airspeed of 0,5 m/s resulted in self-extinguishment, while an airspeed of 1,0 m/s resulted sustained smouldering. It can reasonably be assumed that at a heat flux below 6 kW/m2, the speed of the airflow should be limited to 0,5 m/s. The second series of experiments investigated all phases of the model of self-extinguishment. Small compartments with one, two, or three CLT walls were subjected to a propane fire with a decay phase. Delamination was found to be important in the fire behaviour of the CLT. Delamination occurred when the charring front reached the polyurethane adhesive, which then lost bonding. This resulted in fall-off and exposure of new layer of wood to the fire, which could interfere in the transitions from flaming to smouldering and from smouldering to self-extinguishment. In two experiments, fall-off occurred when temperatures in the compartment were still relatively high. The newly exposed wood contributed rapidly to the fire and flaming was sustained, or smouldering was transformed back to flaming. The CLT in these two experiments continued burning. In two other experiments, fall-off occurred when temperatures in the compartment were lower. As a result, flaming was not sustained. The CLT smouldered and the heat flux on its surface during was below 5 kW/m2; these compartments extinguished. However, relying on fall-off to occur when the compartment has cooled down might be risky due to its unpredictable nature. Alternatively, delamination and fall-off were prevented in a fifth experiment by applying a thicker top lamella. The charring front seized within the thickness of this lamella before it reached the PU adhesive. In all five compartments, the exposed CLT increased the heat release rate and total energy released, and extended the duration of a fire. These were further increased when fall-off resulted in prolonged flaming. Self-extinguishment is currently not part of fire safety considerations for timber high-rises. With further research, self-extinguishment might eventually contribute to a total fire safety concept for tall timber buildings, in addition to active measures. This research extends to translating new insights with regards to self-extinguishment to design and regulatory implications. A suggestion was made for a method to assess the potential for self-extinguishment of CLT structures. The method is based on the experiments and their specific conditions, e.g. with regards to the fire development, fuel load, ventilation conditions, CLT build-up, type of adhesive, wood species, and compartment configuration and scale. It would require further research and verification before the method could be applied in practice. The method consists of two steps. First, a thickness is determined, to be applied to the outer lamella of the CLT in order to prevent delamination. This thickness is based on the calculation of a finite charring depth for a parametric natural fire exposure, taking into account the ventilation conditions and the contribution of the CLT to the fuel load. Second, to allow the transformation to self-extinguishment, the compartment configuration should be such that the heat flux on the CLT surface is limited to 5 kW/m2 during smouldering. This can be achieved by estimating the temperatures of various surfaces and calculating the heat flux on the CLT with the most unfavourable configuration. With regards to building regulations and approval, self-extinguishment might contribute in demonstrating compliance of a timber structure with the Dutch building code. Self-extinguishment, as part of an increased insight in the structural fire behaviour, reduces the probability of collapse as a result of the fire. Despite severe consequences of collapse in a high-rise building, this reduction in probability might contribute in achieving a level of risk and safety as intended by the Dutch building code. Furthermore, an assessment of potential self-extinguishment might be considered in the design of timber buildings according to the Eurocode consequence class 3, which requires a high degree of insight into the structural fire behaviour. Self-extinguishment, as part of an overall fire safety concept, might become part of the risk analysis and the advanced calculations in order to demonstrate the tall timber structure is reliably safe and robust. Finally, new insight can affect the perception of the material and the way it is treated in building regulations and approval. Due to lack of precedents, limited experience, code limitations, and uncertainties regards the performance in fire, there seems to be reluctance to saying tall timber buildings are sufficiently safe. Timber is perceived as a material less suitable for high-rise buildings. More insight into self-extinguishment, its role in a total fire safety concept for tall timber buildings, and its implications on the structural design, could affect this. A more pragmatic approach might be adopted in which any material poses unique design challenges, but can be applied as long as it contributes to safe buildings. While the combustibility of the timber structure will remain a point of attention, its risk should be managed properly, instead of used to discard the material for high-rise buildings. Eventually, insight in the structural fire behaviour of timber structures, including potential self-extinguishment, could contribute to making timber available as a material for high-rise buildings.","fire safety engineering; Timber; Wood; Cross-laminated timber; CLT; High-rise; Fire; Fire safety; Experiments; Self-extinguishment; Fire behaviour; Material; Tall buildings","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2015-09-20","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Structural Engineering","","Building Engineering, Timber Structures and Wood Technology","",""

(mentor)","2015","Future-proof design of quay walls is an interesting issue in civil Engineering, because of the dynamic environment in which quay walls are operating. Designers are confronted with time-changing requirements such as larger retaining heights and heavier loads. However, a technical and financial analysis has revealed that the design of new quay structures can, under certain conditions, be made future-proof by standardization. By standardizing the design, this may achieve a certain degree of flexibility. This means that a quay wall can be converted for multiple types of vessels or multiple types of cargo and therefore becomes future-proof. Various standard principle solutions are applicable. However, it should be noted that the exact dimensions of quay wall components, for instance the substructure (the front wall) and the superstructure (the capping beam or relieving platform), can in principle not be standardized. The dimensions depend namely on major factors such as local geotechnical conditions, surcharges, retaining height and the presence of a relieving platform. Nevertheless, standardization is possible in two ways. Firstly, by driving the front wall to a deeper layer than it is necessary in the first instance and dredging the front side of the quay wall at a later stage. This can be done by constructing all quay walls at equal depth, by area. This is a decision based on the local depth of the navigation channels and the expected business activity in the different areas. Secondly, by making a strategic choice for a particular quay component or a particular port area. Both ways lead to higher initial investment costs but results in a quay wall which is significantly more future-proof. From a technical and financial assessment it can be concluded that when heavy loads and large retaining heights are involved, a combined steel quay wall with a concrete relieving platform (often used by deep-seagoing vessels) is suitable and for inland barges an anchored combined wall should be applied. In case of a relieving platform, the floor should be located at NAP-2m with a length of 15m. Quay walls used by inland barges should consist of a capping beam and a combined wall. This rather conventional cross-sections are the most economical ones.","quay wall; Rotterdam; port; inland vessels","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","Hydraulic Structures","",""

(mentor); Van Wee, G.P. (mentor); De Jong, W.M. (mentor)","2015","High fuel prices and strong competition have put pressure on airlines to reduce costs and become more efficient. For KLM fuel costs were $3.9bn in 2013: 31% of the total expenses. Therefore, focus has been put on fuel efficiency programmes. The pilot in command, the captain, has the final decision about the fuel quantity taken on board of an aircraft. In flight preparation, this pilot can decide to order extra fuel when he or she thinks certain conditions require more fuel. The factors on which this 'extra fuel decision' is based have not been researched before and are not sufficiently known. Gaining insight in the underlying drivers of fuel decisions can contribute to find a solution in which high standards of safety are maintained, while fuel costs are lowered. The research question was therefore formulated as follows: How can fuel decisions by airline pilots during flight preparation and execution be improved? Data analysis was performed to calculate the costs and benefits of taking extra fuel. Interviews were conducted and questionnaires were filled in by 175 KLM pilots and 16 flight dispatchers to gain more insight in the underlying drivers for fuel decisions. Statistical analysis and literature of the Prospect Theory of Kahneman and Tversky were used to analyse the results and to explain the decision-making of the pilot in command. This information served as a base from which a proposal for improvements was created. [...] Fuel decisions by airline pilots during flight preparation and execution might be improved by offering digital flight specific information. To 'expand' the experiences of pilots, this information should include feedback and experiences from colleagues and statistical information of previous flights. This information should always be used as background information. In addition, a flight specific information-application might help to create more trust in the flight plan. Further studies are recommended to analyse extra fuel decisions on an individual level. It is also recommended to test a flight specific information-application to investigate if it serves its purpose: better supporting pilots in flight preparation and execution, creating more awareness and improving their fuel decisions.","KLM; fuel decisions; behavioural decision-making; prospect theory; fuel","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Technology, Policy and Management","Transport & Logistics","","Management of Technology","",""

(mentor); Ngan-Tillard, D.J.M. (mentor); Verhagen, H.J. (mentor); Stam, C.J.M. (mentor)","2015","Quarry rock is a frequently applied construction material in hydraulic engineering. The main reason is its unique stability capacities in environments of high hydrodynamic activity. Furthermore, quarry rock is produced and handled relatively easily and available at numerous locations across the globe. The size, or more precisely, the dimension of rock plays an important role in the realization of granular hydraulic structures. In general, two definitions are applied for the dimension of quarry rock, viz.: the nominal diameter and the sieve diameter. The ratio of both diameters is referred to as the shape factor of quarry rock and is frequently applied to express the one diameter in the other. Quarry rock however consists of a practically infinite variety of sizes and shapes and as a result the material is typically graded. For quarry gradings therefore the shape factor is based on ‘median’ values for the nominal diameter and sieve diameter, which are related to the fifty percent cumulative mass percentage of the grading. In a report published by G.J. Laan (1981) the value of the shape factor for quarry rock was determined to be 0.84. Unfortunately, Laan passed away and the concerned report is missing from the libraries. Despite the resulting lack of theoretical background the value of 0.84 is still widely applied in hydraulic engineering practice, as is recommended by - amongst other literature - the Rock Manual (2007). In this thesis the value of the shape factor has been reassessed. By conducting experiments on 21 samples, consisting of 200-250 rocks, extracted from various gradings, it is found that the shape factor is reasonably well represented by means of a Gaussian distribution. The average value and standard deviation are 0.86 and 0.24 respectively. Furthermore, it is concluded that the value of the shape factor is not constant within a grading. The value of the shape factor slightly decreases for increasing rock size. Such relation is however not discerned over the coarseness of the tested gradings. According to the tested gradings, the value of the shape factor is independent from the shape of the rock, in terms of both elongation and blockiness. For individual rock however, on average the value of the shape factor slightly increases for an increase of elongation as well as blockiness. As a consequence it cannot be completely ruled out that, for gradings consisting of a significantly higher percentage of relatively elongated or blocky rock compared with the tested gradings, the shape factor will increase. Like the shape factor for rock gradings, the shape factor of individual rocks is also represented reasonably well by means of a Gaussian distribution. The average value and standard deviation are 0.84 and 0.083 respectively. Moreover, it is found that the shape factor of an individual rock may exceed the value of 1.0. For such rock the nominal diameter exceeds the sieve diameter. Subesequent research should focus on the shape factor value for gradings of significantly different coarseness and gradings that consist of a significantly higher percentage of relatively elongated or blocky rock compared with the tested gradings, the shape factor will increase. For uncrushed rock it is expected both interests are met.","shape factor; quarry rock; elongation; blockiness","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","","",""

This means that they are traditionally run at continuous high loading levels, most often full-load. The current energy market asks for more flexibility as renewable energy sources continue to penetrate the energy market. Coal-fired power plants are forced to operate at part-loads more frequently, in order to complement changes in the difference between energy demand and intermittent energy supply by renewable sources. The focus of this thesis is on the identification of limiting mechanisms determining the minimum load operating point, and on the thermodynamic performance in sub-Benson operation of a Benson-type coal-fired power plant. An increase of the dynamic load operating window, by lowering the minimum load, increases the adaptability and economic competitiveness to future energy dispatch. This is expected to be of high value in the future. This study assesses the feasibility to operate continuously on non-designed sub-Benson loads. First, the limitations that restrict the minimum load operating point of a once-through supercritical pulverized coal power plant are identified. Secondly, the lower limit of the dynamic load operating window is defined. Thirdly, the thermodynamic performance in sub-Benson operation, in terms of efficiencies and process behavior, is determined. This method is applied to case study Maasvlakte Power Plant 3. It can be concluded that the following limiting mechanisms are critical for low load operation; (1) The minimum flue gas inlet temperature requirement for the NOx-removal system. An indication of 21.7[%boil] minimum (percentage of the maximum live steam production) is required to ensure the minimum DeNOx flue gas inlet temperature. (2) The limited potential to extract steam from the cold-reheat for internal use in sub-Benson operation. Below 20[%boil], the auxiliary steam demand exceeds the maximum potential of internal steam extraction from the cold-reheat, meaning the system cannot operate autonomously anymore. (3) The minimum thermal input supplied by the individual burners which determines the overall thermal input into the boiler. The operating window of the individual burners limits the system to ~17.9[%boil] minimum. (4) The minimum live steam mass flow rate to maintain the minimum required pressure level of 103[bar]. This pressure level ensures homogeneous cooling of the evaporator pipes. The live steam mass flow rate to maintain the required pressure level is 15.9[%load]. The first constraint encountered is the flue gas temperature requirement at the NOx-removal installation. When considering the current minimum load of 25[%boil], it is concluded that the minimum load operating point can be decreased to 21.7[%boil]. This results in a 3.3[%boil] increase of the dynamic load operating window. A model of the case study power plant is developed to simulate the thermodynamic performance, focusing on the sub-Benson load regime. In addition, the simulation obtains an understanding of the processí variable behavior at high turndown ratio. It is concluded that the net efficiency reduces from 46.3[%], at full-load, down to 36[%], at 21.7[%boil]. The loss of efficiency translates to an increase of ~22[%] of the specific raw coal input per megawatt hour produced. At 21.7[%boil], the net power production level is 206[MWe]. This is a relative power output reduction of 14.9[%] compared to the 242[MWe] net power production at 25[%boil].","supercritical; power; part-load; off-design; Benson; pulverized; flexible; performance; dynamic load operating window","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2015-03-19","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Process and Energy","","Energy Technology","","51.9622346, 4.0210335"

Because of this, their in-house knowledge and methods for doing market research in the container shipping market are limited and therefore subject to improvement. NileDutch wants to anticipate to changes quickly in the West African container shipping market. Therefore, NileDutch needs to have access to up to date market information. Therefore, NileDutch wants to widen their in-house knowledge about the West African container shipping market. NileDutch also wants to learn more about market research methodologies in the container shipping market for the present and the future. They would like to get to know these market research methodologies and to see them being applied to the West African container shipping market of 2011 and 2015. Objectives The main objectives of this research are to identify market research methodologies and to apply them to the West African container shipping market for 2011 together with advice for the fleet of NileDutch in the West African container shipping market for 2015. More specific objectives for the market research of 2011 are to identify the carriers and operators together with their container liner services, fleet, and strategy. The demand and supply for full TEUs of NileDutch and the entire West African container shipping market will be determined for 2011. The demand and supply for full TEUs by NileDutch for 2015 will be estimated. Four scenarios estimate the supply of full TEUs by NileDutch for 2015.These four scenarios focus on high net results by minimizing costs and weekly sailing frequencies for which the minimum net freight rate needs to be known. Per scenario the fleet specifications are also given. A statement about the evolution of NileDutch’s 2015 net freight rates in comparison with 2011 due to the changes in supply and demand is given.

Summary of the market study results In the West African container shipping market container volumes to West Africa, come from Asia, East Africa, Europe, the Mediterranean, North America, Oceania, South America, and from West Africa itself. Oceania does not trade directly with West Africa as they have second leg services to West Africa. The West African container shipping market has 45 carriers and 36 operators. The three largest operator groups are Maersk group, CMA CGM Group, and MSC Group, Together they have a market share of 60%, which is more than half the West African container shipping market. MOL and Hamburg Süd complete the top five. The top five is almost three fourth of the West African container shipping market. NileDutch is located at position eight in the operators list with a market share of 3%. The West African container shipping market of 2011 includes 112 liner services using 488 vessels, which represent 45 carriers. There are container liner services, ConRo liner services, and multipurpose liner services. NileDutch has six container liner services. Only the five largest carriers have more container liner services which are Maersk line, Safmarine, Delmas, MSC, and CMA CGM. The average container vessel in West Africa has a nominal TEU capacity of 2.650TEU, a 14 ton TEU capacity of 2.000 TEU and design speed of 21,1 knots. Alphaliner (27/07/2011) provided data about the owned container vessels, chartered container vessels, orders and options per operator in the global container shipping market. Maersk Group MSC Group, and CMA CGM group represent the top three with a share of more than 50% in total nominal TEU capacity and amount of container vessels. The remaining operators in the top ten have shares between 3% and 6% in total nominal TEU capacity and amount of container vessels. NileDutch is ranked at position fifteen with a market share of 0,4%. Only the top fifteen operators have orders and options. Hanjin shipping, MOL and Zim have quite large orders. Hanjin and Zim increase their fleet by almost 50% when looking at their total nominal TEU capacity. Hanjin has orders for 32 container vessels and Zim for 13 container vessels. Maersk group has 20 orders and 10 options for the biggest container vessel in the world. These container vessels have a nominal TEU capacity of 18.000TEU. Alphaliner (29/04/2011 and 02/05/2011) provides data about the liner services and vessels in these liner services. The five largest trades in the West African container shipping market based on the 14 ton TEU capacity shares are the Europe - West Africa trade (35%), the Asia - West Africa trade (25%), the inter West African trade (12%) , the Asia - East Africa - West Africa trade (12%), and the Asia -South America - West Africa trade (7%). When it comes to strategy; the strategy of the competitors of the West African container shipping market can be subdivided in four groups: very large competitors, large competitors, medium competitors, and small competitors. In each group, the competitors try to achieve costs as low as possible. The larger competitors and especially those in the very large group are very focused on achieving low costs to stay the largest in the container shipping market. The principal way to try to achieve low costs is to use the costs advantages of applying economies of scale. They used the largest container vessels possible to meet their share in the demand for TEUs in the West African container shipping market per trade. The larger the container vessels, the lower the costs per TEU. Instead of two small container vessels one should use one large container vessel as this results in lower costs per TEU. Owned container vessels have the cost advantage of having lower long-term costs in comparison with chartered container vessels. Owned container vessels also give more stable cash flows. Chartered container vessels are used to benefit from favorable charter prices in comparison with the capital costs and operational costs of owned container vessels. Time chartered container vessels are also used to meet the demanded TEU capacities quickly in the fluctuating container shipping market. In contrast to NileDutch, each competitor has a more or less 50% - 50% balance between chartered and owned container vessels in terms of total nominal TEU capacity. NileDutch has a 5% share of owned container vessels versus a 95% share of chartered container vessels in terms of total nominal TEU capacity. NileDutch should be able to lower its costs per TEU by owning more container vessels. Due to the low new built prices of 2011 and keeping the long-term lower costs for owned container vessels in mind, the competitors in the large group, very large group, and NileDutch have orders and options for container vessels. The competitors in the two smallest groups did not have the finances to benefit from this. Vessel sharing agreements or slot agreements also help in lowering costs per TEU or to benefit from opportunities in the container shipping market. Larger competitors have relatively more agreements in comparison with smaller competitors. The larger groups of competitors make agreements to improve the provided container liner services for the customers and to have lower costs per TEU when entering new markets or when a market is growing. Again the larger the container vessels the lower the costs per TEU. In case of a vessels sharing agreement or slot agreements these costs per TEU are lower in comparison with transporting the same amount of TEUs by a single vessels instead of sharing TEU space on a container vessels with another competitor. In general costs per TEU can be kept low by applying economies of scale, a good balance between owned and chartered container vessels, vessels sharing agreements, and slot agreements. Having low costs give a higher net result or can make a company more competitive in case of a price war in the market. NileDutch solely focusses on the West African container shipping market. The other competitors are active in other regions of the container market, commodity-shipping market or non-commodity shipping market. As NileDutch is solely active in the container shipping market, they cannot spread their risks over other types of shipping or non-shipping markets in case the West African container shipping market is not doing well. Angola is very important to NileDutch as a significantly 57% of NileDutch’s handled TEUs come from Angola. NileDutch faces big challenges in case container transport from Angola drops. The very large competitors are aggressive first movers, the large competitors are first movers or fast followers, the medium size competitors are fast followers and the small size competitors are late movers. In general, one can say NileDutch is a first mover, but also a fast follower. Being a first mover manifests itself as next. The company is internally organised in such a way that short decision times are possible when wanting to adjust to changes in the market. This is for example the case when chartering container vessels but also when putting up local agencies due to their experience. Their experience about operations and operational costs squeezes the operational cost margins. Their extended network in West Africa helps them arranging changes as their vast knowledge about local cultures, languages, the way of doing business, engagement with local players, personal relations, and meetings with local agencies throughout the year gives them the advantage and opportunity to obtain information and use it to their advantage. Due to these first mover advantages, they are able to anticipate and act ahead of market changes. Being a fast follower manifest itself on the commercial front as they do not have an in-house market research department. Their market information is mainly purchased or outsourced. There are websites which provided market information but these data are not processed and made available to all managers and directors. Their market information comes with a delay in time which prevents fast anticipation to market changes. The West African container shipping market of 2011 has a supply of about 6.2000.000 full TEUs based on the 14 ton TEU capacities of the container vessels used. The trades with Asia and Europe turn out to have the majority share in the market. Combined they supply 60% of the TEUs in the West African container shipping market. The three biggest operators in the market are Maersk with a market share of 26%, MSC with a market share of 17% and CMA CGM with a market share of 16%. Combined, their share is 60% in the entire market. NileDutch is ranked at position 8 with a market share of 2,6%. NileDutch’s supply for 2011 is about 200.000TEU. For 2015, the supply is increased to about 290.000TEU – 325.000TEU. 51% for scenario 1, 55% for scenario 2, 47% for scenario 3, and 66% for scenario 4. NileDutch’s demand for TEUs in the West African container shipping market has increased from about 150.000TEU to 220.000TEU between 2011 and 2015. This is an increase of about 45%. The net freight rate per TEU of 2015 has decreased by about 20% in comparison with 2011. 1.908,51 $/TEU for 2015 and 2.256,08 $/TEU for 2011. The size of container vessels advised to weekly supply these TEUs to meet the demand are as follows for the first three scenarios: nineteen to twenty 2.000TEU – 2.200TEU container vessels in the FEWA liner service, seventeen 800TEU container vessels in the SWAX liner service, thirteen to fourteen 2.400TEU – 2.600TEU container vessels for the WEWA liner service, nine 1.000TEU container vessels for the ECSA liner service, three 200TEU container vessels in the Feeder 1 liner service, and five 1.000TEU container vessels in the Feeder 2 service. The fleet advise for the fourth scenario providing weekly sailing are: twenty 2.500TEU container vessels for SWAX liner service, twelve 2.400TEU container vessels for the WEWA liner service, nine 1.000TEU container vessels for the ECSA liner service, Three 200TEU container vessels for the Feeder 1 liner service, four 300TEU container vessels for the Feeder 2 liner service, six 1.000TEU container vessels for the Feeder 3 liner service, and seven 1.000TEU container service for the Feeder 4 liner service. Main conclusions and recommendations The market research of the West African container shipping market of 2011 is obtained by applying partly Dynamar’s market research approach to data from Alphaliner. In addition to Dynamars approach, data about the vessels used in the West African container shipping market and the strategy of the competitors in the market is added. The strategy of the competitors is determined based on the conceptual model and a portfolio model of Lorange (2005). This makes the knowledge about the vessels in the West African container shipping market and the strategy new to NileDutch. Knowledge obtained by modelling the supply, demand and fleet for NileDutch for 2015 is new to NileDutch as well. The computer model made to obtain this knowledge is partly based on existing modelling methods, alterations to existing work, and new work. The computer model is positivelly validated. The statement about the supply and demand of NileDutch when comparing 2011 to 2015 is new to NileDutch as well. The forecasts and prediction made for 2015 are also new to NileDutch. The most important recommendation for NileDutch is to set up a market research department inside NileDutch headquarters in Rotterdam, The Netherlands and to use consultancy firms every two to five years to carry out market research and advice NileDutch on strategy. This is important for three reasons: - Firstly, currently NileDutch does not have a market research department which makes their market information come with a delay as they use reports from Dynamar and Alphaliner. In addition, the market information that is available is distributed throughout various departments within NileDutch and each person interprets and processes this information for his own opportune reasons. It is not clear which person has which information and if, in case data are processed, reliable methodologies are used. - Secondly, NileDutch in general is a first mover, but a fast follower when it comes to its commercial department. To become a first mover commercially fast access to data about changes in the market is required. Having an in-house market research department, this market information can be provided more quickly. - Thirdly, even though consultancy companies are pricey, their experience, methodologies about market research, advice on strategy, and access to sources to which NileDutch does not have access outweigh the costs. Their work provides insights, which would not become clear in market research done by an in-house market research department. They are also good advisors when a company is in the process of determining or altering its company’s future strategy. Consultancy firms might also ask thought-provoking questions the company had not considered previously. For these three reasons, it is advisable for NileDutch to set up a market research department inside NileDutch headquarters in Rotterdam, The Netherlands and to use consultancy firms every two to five years to carry out market research and advice NileDutch on strategy. Recommendations are also made to improve and expand NileDutch’s knowledge about the West African container shipping market when doing more research and by improving the quality of the research and the computer model. Other recommendations involve alterations and improvements of the computer models and the tool which generates the container vessels in the computer model. These are both technical improvements, data improvements, and modelling NileDutch’s container transport chain more precisely.","West African Container shipping market","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2020-01-01","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Maritime engineering","","Shipping management","",""

(mentor); Van der Duin, P.A. (mentor); De Reuver, M. (mentor)","2015","This research study employed Q-methodology to explore retailer perspectives on the adoption of Near Field Communication. Near Field Communication m-payment has emerged as a promising payment alternative for retailers in the Netherlands, offering attractive technological advantages over existing payment methods. However, the multi-stakeholder nature of m-payment ecosystems means that a comprehensive understanding of the adoption factors and incentives for each stakeholder is needed in order to go past the adoption tipping point and reach critical mass. Limited adoption of previous m-payment systems coupled with an existing body of knowledge that has overlooked the adoption factors for retailers have instigated the need for this research study. This study identified 4 retailer perspective on NFC m-payment adoption. The first perspective represents retailers that rely heavily on customer demand before being enticed to consider adoption. This represents the typical wait-and-see behavior shown by the majority of retailers in the past when it comes to mobile payment adoption, and this is supported by the fact that the majority of participants loaded on this perspective. The second perspective represents retailers that are concerned with the financial consequences of adoption and rely less on the completeness of the mobile payment ecosystem. The characteristics of this perspective represent a group that may be enticed to adopt by offering extrinsic motivation such as financial support. The third perspective represents retailers that are less concerned with financial consequences, but instead focusses on the technical competence of mobile payment. The fourth and final perspective represents retailers that are satisfied with current payment alternatives and will only adopt if mobile payment can improve the efficiency of payment. The use of Q methodology enabled a deeper insight into adoption factors that other common techniques such as surveys may not have provided. The identification of retailer groups extends on conventional adopter groups such as “early adopters” and “laggards”, thus providing a wider breadth of views and responses towards NFC m-payment adoption. These findings inform NFC m-payment providers as to who are willing and capable of adoption, thus possibly accelerating adoption by creating a strong ecosystem. In addition, it also informs providers on the factors they need to improve on in order to attract those who are not yet ready for adoption. For the retailer this leads to an m-payment system that better fits their needs so that they can take advantage of the technological benefits of NFC m-payment.","mobile payment; Near Field Communication; diffusion of innovations; post-adoption; perspectives; retailer; Q-methodology; market segments","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Technology, Policy and Management","Engineering Systems and Services","","Information and Communication Technology","",""

(mentor)","2015","This report describes two methods to analyse the effect of sloshing on ship motions. The first method applies linear potential theory on both the barge and the internal tanks. For the barge the radiation, diffraction and incoming wave potentials are solved. For the internal tanks only the radiation potential is calculated, as there are obviously no incoming or diffracted waves in the tanks. The potentials are then used to solve the added mass, damping and wave forces for the coupled barge-tank system in the frequency domain. By comparing the frequency domain results with the scale model tests results a good agreement was identified for all loading conditions. On top of this the frequency domain approach is very fast and relatively easy to set up. However, linearity is assumed while in the scale model test non-linear sloshing was observed. It is expected that non-linearity will damp out the roll motion of the vessel and it is therefore expected that for increasing wave height the frequency domain solution will overestimate the response. It was also found that both roll RAO peaks are very sensitive to the wave direction. By comparing the roll RAO’s for liquid and frozen cargo in the tanks it was found that sloshing significantly decreases the height of the main roll RAO peak and also creates a lower barge natural frequency. The second method is a more complex time domain model that is based on a coupling between Volume of Fluid solver ComFLOW and ship motions solver aNySIM. In the coupled model the motions of the barge due to waves, without internal tanks, are obtained by using linear potential flow and are calculated in aNySIM. The ship motions calculated in aNySIM are used as input in ComFLOW that calculates the more complex and potentially non-linear motions of the liquid in the spherical cargo tanks. The resulting sloshing loads are again used as input in aNySIM, creating a two-way coupling between the dynamics of the ship and cargo tanks. The time domain results showed a reasonably good agreement with the scale model tests. However, the second, sloshing induced, roll RAO peak is underestimated in the coupled model. This might be due to the type of waves used in the test, uncertainty in the RAO’s and due to the properties of the coupling between ComFLOW and aNySIM. The time domain method is time consuming and complex to set up, but offers more insight in what is really happening. It was shown that non-linear motions of the barge occur due to sloshing in the tanks. It was also found that with partially filled tanks the response of the barge is irregular when exposed regular waves. The influence of the pump tower was also investigated, which showed that due to the damping created by the pump tower the overall roll response is lower and the barge natural frequencies moves to a lower frequency.","sloshing; spherical; tank; offloading; LNG; FLNG; anysim; wamit; comflow; CFD; diffraction; radiation; potential; flow; carrier; diffraction; radiation; waves; linear; non-linear; RAO; roll; frequency; time; domain; barge; ship; cargo; liquid; scale; model; tests","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2016-03-17","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Ship Hydromechanics and Structures","","MSc Offshore and Dredging Engineering","",""

(mentor); Swanborn, R.A. (mentor); Bos, A. (mentor)","2015","One of the major problems associated with oil and gas production is the large volume of produced water. Operators around the world are facing significant costs with the treatment and disposal of produced water. Downhole separation, a relatively new technique, has been developed to reduce the costs of produced water and increase oil production. Downhole separation is the technique where oil and gas from the produced wa- ter is separated at the bottom of the well and re-inject some of the produced water into another formation, while the oil and gas are pumped to the surface. The reduction in cost is owed to the downhole treatment of the produced water since most of the topside produced water treatment facilities are reduced in number. Since most of the produced water does not reach the surface this creates an added value of minimizing the opportunity for contamination of underground sources of drinking water through leaks in casing and tubing during the injection process. The goal of this project was to design a downhole liquid-liquid separator and to evaluate the performance at downhole conditions with the aid of computational fluid dynamics. The separation performance is evaluated experimentally. A dedicated test rig has been designed and built at ProLabNL, a sister company of Ascom Separation, to test the separation efficiency of the downhole separator. The designed system consisted of three hydrocyclone stages in series to polish the water to the desired injectate quality of 100 ppm oil in water, and was operated under downhole conditions, i.e. high temperature (70 - 80 àC), high watercut (90 - 95%) and relatively large oil droplets (ranging from 500 - 1000 [?m]) dispersed in the continuous phase. The system design and the operational method are fully outlined. At the tail-end of production, reservoir pressure is depleted causing increased sand production. In the existing commercial downhole separators, the solids that are produced are re-injected downhole leading to potential plugging of the disposal zone. The proposed downhole fluid separation system is equipped with a de-sander to flush the separated sand with the oil rich stream to the surface. Computational fluid dynamics was used to evaluate the pressure balance and volume flux balance of the internals. An erosion analysis was conducted to investigate the wear due to the sand influx. Furthermore, laboratory tests were conducted to evaluate the influence of a progressive cavity pump (PCP) on the shearing effect of an oil water mixture. The pressure-drop over the pump seems to play a cru- cial role on the amount of droplet breakup which leads to a decrease in separation efficiency of the downhole separator.","DOWS; downhole separator; CFD; computational fluid dynamics","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2018-04-23","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Petroleum Engineering","","Petroleum Engineering","",""

A more detailed wind load calculation method, than the currently used projected-area method, is therefore recommended. Furthermore the need for increasing chord spacing is identifed in an attempt to retain a stiffness dominated structure. This however increases the risk of problems associated with Rack Phase Difference (RPD) which occur during jacking operations and therefore illustrates a conflict within the design of jack-ups as the industry heads for deeper and deeper waters.","jack-up","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","Offshore Engineering","",""

(mentor); Abspoel, R. (mentor); Steenbergen, M. (mentor); Van Almen, M. (mentor)","2015","Dynamics of railway bridges is a complicated problem that normally needs nu- merical simulation to conduct researches on. However, this thesis takes advan- tage of the numerical results provided in previous researches and based on these researches, further conclusions are made by using them in simplified model. Recently long span railway bridges being designed in the Netherlands are being rejected by a particular Eurocode criterion that requires bridges to possess a first lateral natural frequency higher than 1.2Hz. Due to the fact that generally bridge’s first lateral natural frequency decreases as the span increases, it can be seen that 1.2Hz criterion is rejecting almost all bridge with a span longer than 150m. This report succeeds in pursuing the original documents of 1.2Hz criterion and the knowledge in the documents initiates further researches on the lateral dy- namics of railway bridges. Besides 1.2Hz criterion itself, following topics are researched with the information provided by previous researches: 1. Train-bridge lateral resonance mechanisms, including axle repeat pattern resonance and kinematic movement resonance, 2. Lateral force on tracks caused by the operation of railway vehicle and key parameters influencing the force. Taking advantage of the items above, a simplified model for checking the lateral railway bridge dynamics is developed to quantify the lateral dynamic resonance response of railway bridge under horizontal dynamic vehicle load. This method aims to serve for engineering purposes and provide an alternative way of ver- ifying railway bridge lateral dynamics. The practical method is developed by an analytical approach, based on the numerical simulation results provided by other researches. An illustration of the usage of the practical method is conducted on the basis of a real bridge project. The method is also implemented in Matlab scripts to automate the checking procedure.","Eurocode; lateral railway bridge dynamics; 1.2Hz criterion; nosing force; lateral force on track","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2015-03-18","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Structural Engineering","","Steel and Timber Construction","","51.998869, 4.375643"

(mentor); Feijen, M. (mentor)","2015","Pressure locked gratings have many uses, both on land and at sea. This is mainly due to the high degree of flexibility in dimensions and load bearing capacity. Despite the many uses in our surroundings, the term pressure locked grating is unknown to many. This term refers to the way in which the most important connection in pressure locked gratings is manufactured. Pressure locked gratings are galvanized and/or coated to prevent corrosion, galvanization is almost always used. This thesis is primarily focused on the behavior of galvanized pressure locked gratings. A pressure locked grating is made up of three type of bars: load bearing bars, cross bars and support bars. The connections between the load bearing bars and the cross bars are realized by pressing the cross bar into premade notch in the load bearing bar. The bars will deform plastically, which results in a connection based only on friction. This connection is called a pressure locked connection. The load bearing bars serve primarily for load transfer in one direction. The pressure locked connection weakens the load bearing bars. The cross bars redistribute a local load over the load bearing bars outside of the loading area and reduce the buckling length of the individual load bearing bar. The support bars are spot-welded to both the load bearing and cross bars. Pressure locked gratings are calculated according to RAL-GZ-638, a standard published by the Deutsches Institut für Gütesicherung und Kennzeichnung e.V. In this standard, pressure locked gratings are calculated on the basis of linear elasticity theory. A calculation according to the EN 1993-1-1 is not possible because it is not suited for pressure locked gratings. The main objective of this thesis is to determine if a calculation based on the plasticity theory is possible for pressure locked gratings. Through the application of this theory the design strength can be greatly increased, which has a large economic potential. This research is divided up into four parts that are stated below.  Analytical study  Experimental study  FEM validation  Parametric study The vast diversity in size and properties and the complex functioning of the pressure locked connection make pressure locked gratings a difficult product to research. The pressure locked connection also has a big influence on the strength and stiffness. In this galvanizing has a big influence. The analytical study shows that pressure locked gratings fail through: local lateral torsional buckling of one of the load bearing bars, global lateral torsional buckling for the entire pressure locked grating or by a mechanism due to a plastic hinge in de load bearing bars. To research the behavior, numerical models were developed in the FEM-package ABAQUS. To determine the accuracy of these models, experiments were carried out on a number of pressure locked grating geometries. The results of the tests were compared with FEM simulations which made it possible to validate the FEM-models. The validation has taken place on the basis of four test series. Three test series focused on failure mechanisms, namely: collapse due to a mechanism as a result of plastic hinges in the load bearing bars, test series 1A, collapse due to local lateral torsional buckling, test series 2A and collapse due to global lateral torsional buckling of the entire pressure locked grating, test series 2B. The last test series, test series 1B, is aimed at examining the structural behavior of a common used pressure locked grating. After this validation it is possible to make FEM-models for a large number of different geometries. The behavior of these geometries can then be analyzed. The validation shows that failure mode and failure load are correctly determined by the FEM models. There is however a notable difference between the stiffness of the FEM-model and the stiffness of the test specimens. This difference is likely the result of the influence of the pressure locked connection between the load bearing and cross bars. The research shows that all aforementioned failure modes play a role depending on the dimensions of load bearing bars and cross bars. For relatively thick-set load bearing bars pressure locked gratings fail due to a mechanism as the result of plastic hinges in the load bearing bars. For slender load bearing bars pressure locked gratings fail as a result of instabilities. With the aid of FEM models, it is possible to estimate the extent in which the plastic capacity is present in actually produced pressure locked gratings. This analysis shows that in 72% of the produced pressure locked gratings, the full plastic capacity of the load bearing bars can be reached to 96% or more. It is however important to keep in mind that, the dimensions of the load bearing bars are determined by deflection or by strength. This is determined by the load bearing bar height and span. When deflection is determining the dimensions of the load bearing bars, a plastic calculation methodology is not useful, because it only increases the design strength. It can thus be stated that the full plastic capacity cannot be fully used. On the basis of this study it is not yet possible to apply a plastic calculation methodology on pressure locked gratings. This is because this research shows that the pressure locked connection can have a big influence on plastic strength. It is not clear if the pressure locked connection always has the same influence on the plastic capacity. It is possible that the plastic capacity is influenced by fatigue, corrosion and manufacturing tolerances.","steel; pressure locked gratings; FEM; experiments","nl","master thesis","","","","","","","","2017-03-16","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Structural Engineering","","Structural and Building Engineering","",""

These two methods are tested and the method of Jonkers was found to be the most suitable option, since it is far less complex than the method of Lodewijks. Due to the known overestimation of the power requirements of the method of Jonkers, a modification is proposed, to compensate for this. This improved method is verified with a theoretic case study.

(mentor); Beelaerts van Blokland, W.W.A. (mentor)","2015","Over the last decades, air traffic facilitates the movement of people and goods all over the world, enabling economic growth and development. Despite the impact air traffic has on industries and systems all over the world, the aviation industry is influenced by the same factors as well. Energy prices, the economic situation, population growth and other aspects do impact airline businesses, as the most recent economic downturn illustrates perfectly. The world we live in over a couple of decades may vary in many aspects and it is impos- sible to predict all the factors, decisions and actions that will shape it in the future. The understanding of world as one global system, its dependencies and dynamics can never be perfect, and is limited by our knowledge. Now and in the future. Despite the ability to make perfect forecasts how the world will look like in the future, scenarios can help to define how factors will act so a variety of future pathways can be explored. In order to help airline businesses and organisation, such as the IATA, formulating and validating strategies, this work focuses on the development of a framework that enables the forma- tion and validation of scenarios that are based on dynamics, dependencies and relations of the global system. Based on a system dynamics approach, a Integrated Assessment Model is developed based on proven concepts of socio-economic and climatological modelling. This model will form the basis for the other models that will be added to calculate the demand for passenger kilometers, irrespective of the transport mode. Based on pricing and time expenditures of a journey by a transport mode, a distribution of passenger kilometers per transport mode is calculated. An Air Transport Model is used to mimic airline operations based on three types of aircraft. In this model, the transport demand, expressed in RPKs, is used to drive the demand for flights. Depending on the utilisation capacity ratio, an airline is able to cope with the demand. Above capacity utilisation ratios, the airline has to delay flights or order new assets (aircraft or runways) in order to accommodate the transport demand. Under some situations, this might leed to higher airfares or higher time expenditures per flight, which affect the balance of transport kilometers in respect to the other transport mode. Based on the performed amount of flights and RPKs, the Air Transport Model calculated essential KPIs, which are used to express the performance of the airline businesses. A Value Operations Methodology is used to validate the performance for both economic and non-economic aspects of an airline. By this methodology, several aircraft options and airline strategies can be validated under different socio-economic scenarios. Eventually helping airlines to improve their short-term as well as long-term strategical decisions.","airline; performance; KPI; transport; system dynamics; validation; holistic; operations","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2015-04-13","Aerospace Engineering","Air Transport Operations","","","",""

However in the growing application of large (wireless) sensor networks it is not always feasible to connect each sensor node to a hard-wired clock distribution network. Generally in such systems the sensor nodes are only connected via a (wireless) communication network, hence there have been implementations where clocks are synchronized via the network nodes, in general these solutions synchronize the network nodes in the range of milliseconds up to microseconds. Though some applications, like SPADnet, demand a network based clock synchronization in the range of picoseconds. Currently the SPADnet system is equipped with a hard-wired clock distribution network, this clock network does not scale well. Since one of the goals of SPADnet is to create a scalable system, a network based clock synchronization solution is a better alternative. In this thesis a hybrid solution is presented, where a hard-wired clock synchronization network is combined with a network based clock offset estimator. This combination enables scalability while maintaining high precision. A novel least squares synchronization algorithm is optimized and implemented in hardware equipped with a delayline FPGA TDC, allowing picosecond clock synchronization.","network based; clock synchronization; FPGA; SPADnet","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Circuits and Systems","","Embedded Systems","",""

(mentor)","2015","Freight emissions in the global supply chain are one of the fastest-growing sources of pollution that lead to various environmental problems including climate change. As leadership from governments alone is proving not to be sufficient, Green Freight Supply Chain Leadership (GFSC leadership), where shippers and Logistics Services Providers (LSPs) lead their transport suppliers in reducing transport related emissions, is a feasible alternative for reducing global emissions. However, no research has yet been conducted on this alternative leading to missed opportunities to effectively combat climate change. Therefore, a case study was conducted to make a model that depicts how shippers and LSPs, as the leaders, can use their customer power to lead their transport suppliers, as followers, in reducing transport related emissions. The case study focused on: (1) how the shippers/LSPs that are currently considered leaders in reducing freight emissions exercise their leadership, (2) how this leadership can be improved and (3) how other shippers/LSPs can effectively lead their transport suppliers. Most notable conclusions are that the current leaders argue that a GFSC leader should lead stakeholders within and outside the supply chain that can (in)directly contribute to freight emissions reduction; that the current leaders lack the bigger picture and that this often leads to less effective strategies being implemented; a GFSC leadership model that can support a shippers/LSPs to reduce freight emissions by providing an overview of the different actions they can take and their consequences. The study can be improved in several areas, most notably further research on how to lead other stakeholders than transport suppliers and including the perspective of transport suppliers to the current model.","transport emissions; supply chain; supplier development; green transport; emission reduction","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Technology, Policy and Management","Transport and Logistics","","","",""

(mentor); Rudinac, M. (mentor); Chandarr, A. (mentor)","2015","Due to population ageing, the cost of health care will raise in the coming years. One way to help humans, and especially elderly people, is the introduction of domestic robots that can assist people in daily life such that they are less dependent on home care. Joint visual attention models can be used for natural robot-human interaction. Joint visual attention is that two humans or a robot and a human have a shared attention to the same object. This can be accomplished by pointing, eye-gaze or by using speech. The goal of this thesis is to develop a non-verbal joint visual attention model for object detection that integrates gestures, gaze, saliency and depth. The question that will be answered in this report is: how can the information from gestures, gaze, saliency and depth be integrated in the most efficient way to determine the object of interest? Existing joint visual attention models only work when the human is in front of the robot, so that the human is in view of the camera. Our model should be more flexible than existing models, so it needs to work in different configurations of human, robot and object. Furthermore, the joint visual attention model should be able to determine the object of interest when the pointing direction or the gaze location is not available. The saliency algorithm of Itti et al. [1] has been used to create a bottom up saliency map. The second bottom-up cue, depth, is determined by means of segmenting the environment to extract the objects. Apart from the bottom-up cues, top-down cues can be used as well. The pointing finger is identified and based on the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the finger the pointing direction will be retrieved. A pointing map is created by means of the angle between the 3D pointing direction vector and the 3D vector from the pointing finger to the object. A hybrid model, which computes a gaze map, has been developed that switches depending on textureness of the object between texture based approach and color based approach. Depending on the configuration of the human, robot and object, three or four maps are available to determine the object of interest. In some configurations, the pointing map or gaze map is not available. In that case the combined saliency map is obtained by point wise multiplication of these three maps. If all four maps are at our disposal, all maps are added and multiplied by the pointing mask. When the human and robot are opposite of each other and pointing, bottom up saliency and depth are combined, 93.3% of the objects are detected correctly. If the human is standing next to the robot, the gaze map, bottom up saliency map and depth map are combined, then the detection rate is 67.8%. If robot, human and object are standing in a triangular shape, the detection rate is equal to 96.3%. The main contribution is that the joint visual attention model is able to detect objects of interest in different configurations of human, robot and object and it also works when one of the four cues is not available. Furthermore, a hybrid model has been developed that is able to create a probability gaze map. Depending on the textureness of the object, the model chooses texture based approach or color based approach to generate this gaze map. The probability pointing map is generated using the 3D point cloud data instead of 2D information, which results in an accurate pointing map.","Joint visual attention; shared attention; attention; human-robot interaction; pointing; gestures; Gaze; saliency; sensor fusing; computer vision","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2016-01-01","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","BioMechanical Engineering","","BMD","",""

(mentor); Zanuttigh, B. (mentor); Verhagen, H.J. (mentor); Ockeloen, W.J. (mentor)","2015","Seaports are often protected against waves and currents by rubble mound breakwaters. At the interface between outer breakwater slope and seabed a toe structure is often build, which provides stability to the outer slope. The toe consists of a relatively small heap of rock. Since 1977 dedicated studies are made to the stability of these rock elements under wave attack. A large number of stability methods is available, but prediction accuracy is low and validity ranges are too small for use in practice. Clarity on applicability of these methods is desired by designers. In Baart (2008) a new approach towards toe stability is defended. The ‘decoupled model approach’ determines stability with a two-step model. In the first step local hydraulic conditions right above the toe bed are calculated. The second step uses these conditions in a general formula for stone motion to predict motion. In this thesis the decoupled model approach is implemented and tested by means of the computational fluid dynamics model IH-2VOF. Prediction capacity of existing toe stability methods is reviewed against numerical results. The approach predicts motion rather than an amount of damage. To achieve this, critical values for stability and damage were imposed where necessary. The IH-2VOF model was reviewed first. Convergence tests gave recommendations for the computational grid layout. During testing it was found that position of the partially standing wave, produced by breakwater reflection under regular waves, is of major importance when reviewing different tests. It was discovered also that turbulence modelling in IH-2VOF did not function properly. The Nammuni-Krohn (2009) cases were modelled and numerical results were compared with physical measurements by Nammuni-Krohn. Little correspondence was found, likely caused by differences between numerical and physical model. High sensitivity to stone properties (diameter, porosity and Forchheimer coefficients) was encountered. Analytical solutions for flow velocity either over- or underestimated the numerical results. Work by Peters (2014a) increased confidence in the utility of IH-2VOF for breakwater modelling. Under the assumption that turbulence is not of large importance, the Ebbens (2009) cases were modelled. By literature study the formulae by Izbash (1930), Rance and Warren (1968), Dessens (2004), Steenstra (2014) and Peters (2014b) were selected to predict stone motion. Calibration of these formulae was necessary; Rance and Warren (1968) and Peters (2014b) produced most reliable results. They probably do not need any calibration, making them more universally applicable. Prediction of motion by toe stability methods and decoupled model approach were compared. The formulae by Van der Meer (1991), Gerding (1993) and Van der Meer (1998) give good agreement when validity limits are respected. If neglected, prediction capacity did not decrease much. Van Gent and Van der Werf (2014) and Muttray et al. (2014) then perform good as well. Low sensitivity to the critical values for stability and damage was found. The decoupled model approach is considered to be appropriate to determine toe stability. The results in this study should on the other hand not be used for design purposes as long as some fundamental problems are not solved. The incorrect turbulence calculation, high sensitivity to stone properties and velocity measurement difficulties of the motion formulae are the main issues which should be investigated in further research.","breakwater; toe stability; IH-2VOF; numerical evaluation; decoupled model approach","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","Hydraulic Engineering","",""

Use is made of mini-tuft flow visualization and five hole probe pressure surveys. The results are compared with CFD simulations. The experiments were performed at the most important mission points of the D8: cruise, descent, start of climb, and top of climb. CFD was only performed for cruise and top of climb. From the pressure distributions the distortion coefficient, DC(60), was calculated, the maximum variation in pressure over a specified circumferential segment (60°). At cruise the DC(60) equaled ~0.3, compared to DC(60)~0.1-0.2 for conventional aircraft. The D8 model caused cross-flow to the propulsors, the flow is directed towards the sides of the model. Both fans rotate in the same direction, such that one propulsor has the flow in the direction of rotation, and the other has the flow opposite to the direction of rotation, causing an asymmetry between the left and right propulsor. The flight phase is characterized by ?, the angle of attack, ?, the ratio of tip velocity over tunnel speed, and ?, the yaw angle. It is found that at a high value of ? the pressure differences at the fan-face are reduced by engine suction, lowering the distortion and counter-acting the cross-flow. A low value of ? means a relative lower influence of the propulsor on the flow, such that the propulsor is not able to (fully) counter-act the cross-flow, resulting in a higher difference in DC(60) and power required between the left and right propulsor. Changing ? mainly changes the location of the pressure distributions. The results from experiments agree well with CFD, there is a 1% deviation in DC(60) at top of climb condition, and 6% at cruise. The pressure distributions look similar and the pressure coefficient values scale equally, from -0.8 to 0. Further research should focus on the exact fan response on the distortion. The D8 used conventional engines, optimized for uniform inflow. Developing a BLI optimized engine could further increase the BLI benefit. The D8 model induced cross-flow, resulting in an asymmetry between the left and right engine. Eliminating this cross-flow by a change in model design could also decrease the distortion.","BLI; boundary layer ingestion; distortion; D8; inlet distortion; NASA N+3","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","Aerodynamics, Wind Energy, Flight Performance and Propulsion","","Aerodynamics","",""

As an example, offshore pipe laying is one of the most applicable areas for welding. In this industry, welding plays main role and any defect in welding can lead to disastrous events.Offshore pipe laying is coupled strongly to the oil and gas industry for the extraction and transportation of hydrocarbons from the sea bed. A number of these pipe lines have two dissimilar layers. The inner layer is manufactured from a corrosion resistance alloy (CRA), however, the outer layer is normally a carbon-manganese steel which is cheap. If the inner and outer layer of the pipe are bonded metallurgically, they are called clad pipes. If these two layers are bonded mechanically, they are called, lined pipes. The type of welding in clad or lined pipes can be considered as dissimilar welds since these pipes consist of two dissimilar metal layers. Generally in welding technology, depending on the method of welding, a filler metal is chosen to provide the reasonable chemical and physical compatibility between the filler and base metal. In order to apply and investigate the compatible materials for the clad/lined pipes different filler wires could be used for each layer of the pipe, a superalloy for the inner part and a low carbon steel for the outer part. The compatibility of these two materials in terms of chemical and physical properties is the most important factor to avoid and minimize the introduction of microstructural defects in the weld metal especially at the interface of the two filler metals.","dissimilar welding","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2018-03-12","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Materials Science & Engineering","","Master of Science","",""

(mentor)","2015","This Msc. Thesis builds upon a work-in progress called collocal which researched room-level indoor-localization. Localization is the action of estimating the position of a certain entity on a map. For example tracking the postion of furniture and other inventory in a building over a long period of time. To localize these entities other static nodes are employed that know their own location. These static nodes, called anchors, beacon their coordinates periodically. Mobile nodes are the entities that try to estimate their position based on these beacon messages. In conventional systems this beaconing is done asynchronously. System designers employ complex schemes to prevent anchor nodes from beaconing at the same time to avoid interference. These systems consume lots of energy at the mobile node, because they have to keep their radio on for a longer time. A deployment of such a localization system is expected to last for a long term period without replacing batteries of the used device. Counterintuitive to what asynchronous system designers do, in collocal the anchor nodes beacon at the same time on purpose. Collocal reduces the energy consumption considerably by shortening the listening interval at the mobile node. Collocal however suffers from two major drawbacks: a dead zone area (an area where you can not be localized) between anchor nodes and a very high bit-error rate. In this Msc. thesis the two problems are solved with the use of orthogonal codes. I was able to improve the battery lifetime of the mobile node from 3 months in the asynchronous case to 2 years using a localization period of 1 second. The proposed method is evaluated against five state-of-the-art localization algorithms.","indoor-localization; capture effect; orthogonal codes; spread spectrum; low-energy","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Embedded Software","","Embedded Systems","",""

This master thesis presents the design process of the IDE Energy Challenge Network, a network that aims at changing the energy consuming behaviour of IDE occupants. The elements of the network and the entire design serve as a starting point, research tool and source of inspiration for TU Delft to actively involve its occupants in the environmental challenge. With the aid of literature resources it became more clear on where energy is wasted, why it is wasted and how behaviour can be changed to conserve energy. The goal was to design a network for the IDE faculty, so the broad perspective was narrowed to the IDE faculty energy culture. Observations, interviews and more research showed that the use of heating, lighting, laptops, windows and sun blinds had the largest energy saving potential. These activities are translated in explicit and implicit interventions: an energy feedback icon (designed with the aid of six master students), a social glue, a translation of CO2 emissions and triggers in the immediate working environment of occupants. The icon was elaborated and prototyped and triggers focussed on lighting and heating use were implemented in an open workspace in combination with a social motivation. The idea behind the icon is valuable for the occupants; it will trigger the discussion about energy-use and can give information that people need to change their behaviour. In addition the trigger for the heating system supported occupants to understand the system better and the social motivation had impact, though the light intervention needs to be researched more. These insights are integrated in the future plan for the IDE faculty that recommends what elements need to be implemented and when and how to involve the occupants of TU Delft in reaching the goal.","sustainability; practice theory; behavioural change; design","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Industrial Design","","Master of Science Design for Interaction","",""

(mentor); Van Duin, J.H.R. (mentor); Wiegmans, B. (mentor); Halim, R.A. (mentor)","2015","Due to the recent hype around 3D printing technology regarding its disruptiveness for global manufacturing and supply chains, and thus transport in general, an attempt has been made to assess its impact on the global maritime container transport for the next 20 years. The first step was to gain insight of the 3D printing technology and its sector using literature and market reports. It appears 3DP is still mostly in its infancy. Only basic plastic processes are at the most advanced level. High quality plastic and metal processes are around the pre-production phase, while other material processes are still undergoing experiments. The market and its technical capabilities will surely grow steadily in the next decades. Several improvements can already be expected in terms process improvements, speed, quality control and materials for the coming decade. The second step involves the assessment of how 3DP relates to current manufacturing and supply chain theories, and to subsequently develop a score model to quantify the current impact of 3DP on manufacturing and supply chains. 3DP provides manufacturing firms a unique set of attributes. As firms aim for increasing competitiveness, they will do so by upgrading their competitive capabilities. 3DP influences these capabilities differently (compared to conventional manufacturing) depending on the product that the firm makes and the market in which the firm operates. The 3D Competitiveness Score Model was developed to assess and quantify its competitiveness (or impact) for different markets. It shows to be capable of predicting market potential for a type of product, but not exactly the market penetration. The location of 3DP deployment impacts the supply chain and its logistics. The analysis shows that 3DP has been deployed in centralized as well as decentralized manufacturing setups. Case studies of the dental implants and hearing aid industry suggest a high 3DP market penetration also leads to the decentralization (localization) of manufacturing. Market data from the case studies have been used to formulate the relationship between score model scores and the decentralization level, which will be used to derive transport flows. Due to its extensiveness in terms of variables and statistics used, the World Container Model will form the basis for assessing the future 3DP impact on the world container transport. Five different future scenarios are formed based on varying technological advancement rates of 3DP. Based on the notion that the decentralization level equates to the percentage of transport volume reduction in tons for NSTR 9 commodities (final goods), and allocation of this volume to the supplying NSTR group based on the raw material composition of the NSTR 9 subgroup, the new O/D matrix containing TEUs distribution between countries can be compiled. The WCM results show that 3DP is not likely to cause a threat, in the form of significant throughput or transport flow reduction, for the global container transport in the next two decades. As the GDP and world population is not likely to decline the next 50 years, the global trade will likely continue to generate a high global transport demand, including container transport. This partly neutralizes the threat of reduction in container transport demand. Any reduction will be masked by the stronger growth of container transport activity. The Port of Rotterdam will remain among the top 11 of the largest ports in the world in terms of container throughput. As a major port, the change of container flow in several links caused by 3DP is likely compensated by an increase of transport flow on other links, and the high global growth of container transport demand.","3d printing; wcm; world container transport; world container model; freight modelling; gravity model; logit model; logit choice; 3DP; am; additive manufacturing; rapid manufacturing","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Technology, Policy and Management","Transport and Logistics","","Transport, Infrastructure & Logistics","",""

(mentor); Aravind, P.V. (mentor)","2015","Solid Oxide Fuel Cells operate at high temperatures, which places stringent requirements on the ceramic materials in these devices. Optimizing the design by thermal stress minimization could increase the life expectancy of a fuel cell. In order to do this it is important to have a detailed understanding of the heat flows and temperature profiles in SOFCs. Because of the high temperatures it is expected that radiative heat transfer plays an important role in the thermal behavior of the cell. This phenomenon is however often neglected in SOFC modeling. Arguments often used for neglecting thermal radiation is the lack of knowledge of material properties or to save computational time. A literature study on thermal radiation in solid oxide fuel cells shows that the results from past research are not always in agreement. Some articles about radiation in the anode, cathode and electrolyte (or PEN-structure) even show completely contradictory results. Modeling studies have been performing in multiple steps, all simulations are performed using Ansys Fluent. The SOFC models are all hydrogen fueled. To study the effects of thermal radiation in the anode, cathode and electrolyte simplified 2D representations of the PEN-structure were developed. Because the material properties are not well known the results are obtained for a wide range of optical properties, on two different geometries. The results show that in the limit of high optical thickness of the anode and cathode the entire PEN-structure can be considered opaque, which means only radiation emitting from the anode and cathode surface will be important. Thermal radiation in the electrolyte has a negligible effect on the temperature profiles in the PEN-structure. To study the effect of surface-to-surface radiation a 2D model of a planar SOFC is developed. In this model uniform heat sources are used to account for the heat released due to electrochemical reactions and irreversibilities. Since the surface properties are not well known the temperature profiles throughout the domain are obtained for a wide range of optical properties, for both a co-flow and a counter-flow arrangement. The results show that thermal radiation has a very small effect on the temperature profiles in the domain. It was also found that the results are not very sensitive to the surface emissivities. The results are also obtained with the PEN-structure participating in radiative heat transfer, which verifies the statement that these materials can be considered opaque. To obtain more accurate results and to check the assumption of uniform heat sources a 3D-model of a single channel planar SOFC is developed. This model is also used to study the influence of participating gases. Instead of assuming uniform heat sources the ‘Fuel Cell and Electrolysis’ add-on module is used to model the relevant fuel cell phenomena. The model outputs show that using uniform heat sources is not an accurate assumption. The results also show that radiation has a very small effect on the temperature profiles in the domain, and that the ratio of radiative heat flux to total heat flux is not higher than 9%. Similar to the 2D planar cell model, the results are not sensitive to surface emissivities. The effect of participating gases is studied by considering water vapor as a participating component for the radiative transfer equation. The results show this participating gas has a negligible effect on the temperature profiles in the domain. The reason for small radiation effects is because temperature gradients are small in the direction were radiation has the most effect. Temperature gradients are shown to be dominant in axial direction, or in the direction of the flow, which is important for further studies on thermal stress minimization. To study the effect of radiative heat transfer in a completely different fuel cell design, a 3D model of an anode supported tubular SOFC is developed. The ‘SOFC with Unresolved Electrolyte’ add-on module is used to model the relevant fuel cell phenomena. It is expected that radiation effects are slightly more important in this tubular SOFC model. However this model does not work optimal yet, and no results with radiative heat transfer have been obtained yet. The results in this thesis show that radiative heat transfer in single channel SOFCs can be neglected when the temperature field has to be determined for thermal stress minimization.","Solid Oxide Fuel Cell; Radiative Heat Transfer; Computational Fluid Dynamics; Thermal stress","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Process and Energy","","Sustainable Process And Energy Technologies","",""

Starting with a low level grid, more points are added based on the values of the Sobol variances, which are estimated values. The Sobol variances provide an indication of the importance of each variable and interactions between variables.

Cloud computing allows resources to be provided as general utilities, which users can lease and release in an on-demand fashion through the Internet. In this thesis an HTTP based mobile messaging solution is designed, implemented and described and deployed in the Amazon Cloud, with the main goal of determining to what extent the availability of mobile messaging services improves when deployed in the Amazon Cloud. Three testing environments are proposed for deploying mobile messaging services, i.e. using a proprietary server, Auto Scaling service and the Elastic Load Balancing service provided by Amazon. The architectures for all three scenarios are described and illustrated, and a description is provided of their implementation. Based on performance tests executed in all three scenarios the improvement in availability is determined. Also stress tests are executed in all scenarios with the purpose to compare the performance, i.e. the average response time required to process a subscriber’s request for service, of each scenario with each other. A comparison of the test results provides insight into the availability of the tested messaging service, and the relationship that exists between each scenario’s performance.","IMS; cloud computing; SMS; HTTP; performance test; availability; auto scaling; load balancing","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Computer Science","","Information Architecture","",""

(mentor); Joshi, Y.V. (mentor)","2015","Verge grass is being considered to replace expensive wood pellets (thus reducing imports) as potential bio-energy resources for use in co-firing. However, drying of these verge grass resources is very important because of its high moisture content (almost 60 % wt.) and also results in an increased heating value for the fuel. Drying is the first process which occurs before torrefaction of biomass (which serves as an important pre-treatment step before co-firing with coal). Though fixed bed drying models have been studied in the past, development of drying models for drying verge grass have so far not been investigated. The drying of verge grass in fixed bed using a system of coupled differential equations in the gas phase and algebraic equations in the solid phase have been used to setup mass and energy balances has been investigated. The system of differential and algebraic equations has been solved by the Runge-Kutta method using ordinary differential equation solvers available in MATLAB® and by using finite difference techniques. The behaviour of the process variables (air humidity, air temperature, solid moisture content and solid temperature) with time and height has been investigated. Further a sensitivity analysis has been performed to study the effect of the influence of varying process parameters such as inlet air flow rate and temperature on the drying process. To validate the model, data from experiments performed with grass on a lab-scale drying and torrefaction setup were used at the Energy Technology research group have been used. With increase in the inlet air flow rate and the air temperature the drying time period was reduced due to an increase in the drying rate. Under certain conditions the model was insensitive with regard to increase in the number of grid points used in modelling in space and time. The simulation results however weren’t in agreement with experimental results and need to be further to investigate the validity of the assumptions or correlations used in the process of modelling.","drying; fixed beds","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2015-03-10","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Process and Energy","","","",""

(mentor)","2015","The impressive features, both in a design and technical aspect, of the Organic LED (OLED) lighting technology have attracted the interest of the research and commercial world and have recently be in the spotlight of the automotive industries, like the Lighting Department of Audi. Some of the most exciting features of these lights are the exibility, transparency and the very small thickness. It is reasonable, therefore, that in order to take full advantage of this new technology the electronics that drive these lights, that is the dc/dc converter, should also be characterised of low prole, exibility and small size. A boost towards the direction of the converter minimization and high power density operation could be the recently commercialised power switching technology of Gallium Nitride (GaN) devices. This technology, which exploits the advantages of the wide band gap semiconductors, offers high frequency, high power density, low switching losses operation and low profle design, as well. As every newly commercialised technology, the areas of application that at most exploit the advantages of these switches are still to be found, but it is expected that applications that require high power density or low profle features, like the OLED applications, could benefit the most from the GaN technology. This area is the exact topic of the current master thesis. At this project a dc/dc converter based on GaN switching devices is designed and built. The converter is purposed for the driving of Organic LED lights that belong to the tail light system of a vehicle. As such, the electrical, mechanical and thermal specifications of the converter are based on the guidelines of the Lighting Department of the Audi automotive industry and the nature of the Organic LED lighting. At this thesis, the required dc/dc converter is designed, built, measured and assessed for its adequacy to the defined requirements. During the design part of this project the necessary simulations are conducted. For the purpose of estimating the losses of the GaN device a detailed analytical model for the switching transients is used. Also, both the possibilities of using a planar and a discrete coil are investigated during the simulations and the two components, which were built in the lab, are compared experimentally. A final prototype of the converter is also built in the lab and the experimental and simulated results are then compared and assessed. The assessment of the results showed that the features of the GaN device can be fully exploited at this application and can offer the low profile and high power density requirements. In order, however, to achieve the minimization of the magnetic component more advanced and wider range of core materials are required, especially if a planar coil is desired. Finally, full exploitation of the detailed analytical GaN loss model requires specialised software tools or accurate analytical models in order to determine the values of the various parasitics and the thermal resistance of the component, both strongly related to the PCB layout. This, also, means that during the design procedure in order to achieve better accuracy -which is required at applications which push the frequency to the limits - the PCB design layout parameters should be included in the iterative process of the parameter specification","GaN; Gallium Nitride; Organic LEDs; OLED; Buck Boost; Boundary Conduction Mode; Valley Switching; Switching Model; Analytical Model; Planar Coil","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Electrical Sustainable Energy","","","",""

(mentor); Hoogendoorn, R. (mentor)","2015","In recent years, the interest in and development of automated vehicles and its driver supporting systems have significantly grown. Car manufacturers predict to launch the first highly automated cars in the early 2020’s. But before the level of full automation is reached, the control over the vehicle will be shared between the driver and the automation. This sharing of control implies the occurrence of handovers of control and therefore the need for a new human machine interface in these automated vehicles. This thesis is the result of the assignment: “Design an HMI that controls safe (for both driver and traffic), comfortable and efficient authority transitions in a highly automated vehicle using research on new demands for interaction”. The goal was to integrally design an HMI that enables the transitions of control between driver and automated system by supporting the driver in its perception, analysis and decision-making tasks during its changing role in these authority transitions. The conclusions on the analysis are combined and form an HMI framework for ATs. An AT blueprint identifies the general takeover procedure in 7 steps: highly automated driving, take-over or monitoring request, information processing, decision making, task execution, system limit, and lower level of automated driving. The driver reengagement behaviour exists of 4 consecutive steps, with the goal to identify the ‘potential danger in the own lane’, ‘potential danger disregarding location’, ‘destination and potential accident avoidance’, ‘completing mental models’. The information in the road scene and truck layout elements can be prioritized as 1) own lane/road in front far ahead, 2) own lane/road in front close by, 3) left bottom mirror and ICL (dependent on how speed critical the situation is), 4) other mirrors and object in the road scene. The mental models which should be obtained during ATs are ‘current automation state’, ‘current vehicle state’, ‘current driver state’, ‘desired driver state’, ‘close surroundings’, ‘general traffic situation’, ‘landscape and environment’. Furthermore, a list of design guidelines regarding HMIs for ATs is formulated. The Authority Transition HMI divides the tasks and communication between the human operator and automated operator via a structured communication system, categorizing the information and displaying it in three levels in the vehicle cockpit. The concept provides peripheral support in a multimodal and spatial way that adapts to the behaviour of the driver. The interaction of the concept is presented in an interaction framework scenario which defines the AT process by means of a natural driver-automation dialogue. The process is set up as a concise step by step process in which each action by one of the operators should be confirmed by the other. The functionality of the concept is realized though different features which are integrated in the existing vehicle HMI layout. The concept enables the ATs through a collaborative steering wheel, peripheral HUD, haptic seat, speech based sound display and clear automation visuals in the ICL. The usage of the AT HMI is presented by means of a step by step scenario, addressing all HMI features. Additionally, whenever the AT is not succesful, due to a non-reactive driver, the HMI triggers the automated operator to shut the system down and activate the safety backup mode by means of a safety stop on the emergency lane. The evaluation of the HMI concept is executed by integrating a full scale prototype in the driving simulator. The goal of the simulator user test was to give insight in the level of safety, comfortability and effectiveness of the concept. It can be concluded that the HMI framework for ATs provided a solid basis for the design of the AT HMI concept. Furthermore, it can be concluded that the concept provides a significant step in the right direction towards safe, comfortable and effective ATs. Both provide a basis for future research and development towards realization and implementation of AT systems in vehicles.","automation; driver interaction; research through design; authority transitions","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Industrial Design","","Applied Ergonomics and Design / Integrated Product Design","",""

(mentor); Molenaar, W.F. (mentor); Bakker, K.J. (mentor); Molendijk, W.O. (mentor)","2015","The lock complex at Terneuzen is the main entrance for ships coming from the Westerscheld and navigating towards the cities of Terneuzen and Ghent. The construction of a new large lock at the lock complex of Terneuzen is planned to increase its capacity. This lock will be built between the existing locks. The ground level is situated at NAP +6 meter. The minimum normative sea water level occurring twice a year is NAP -2.85 meter. The new lock will have larger dimensions than the current locks. It is assumed that a ship with a draft of 13.1 meter must be able to use the lock tide independently. Because of the large allowable draft the lock must be founded to a depth of NAP -17.26 m. It is becoming increasingly difficult to construct the new lock with traditional building methods like combi– or diaphragm walls to such extent. In this master thesis the use of pneumatic caissons as alternative construction method for the new lock in Terneuzen has been elaborated. Pneumatic caissons have been used for many times as construction method. However, pneumatic caissons have never been used with the dimensions required for the new lock head. (l = 132m, w = 45m & h = 33m) The pneumatic caisson method involves the construction of a relative rigid concrete box at ground level that is lowered into the ground by excavating the soil underneath it. Under the bottom slab of a pneumatic caisson an air-pressurized space, called the working chamber, is present which is made up of tapering walls around the perimeter of the caisson base slab. These tapering walls are called the cutting edges of the caisson. The working chamber is kept dry by the presence of air pressure. Due to the air pressure, groundwater is not able to enter the working chamber. The deeper the caisson is located below the water table, the higher the air pressure should be. In this master thesis two construction alternatives for the lock heads with help of pneumatic caissons are elaborated: 1. The construction of one large pneumatic caisson with a length of 132 meter, width of 45 meter and a height of 33 meter containing the complete lock head including the gate chamber and gate recess. The working chamber is divided into 14 compartments. 2. The construction of two (compartmentalized–) pneumatic caissons which can be subsided independently. One caisson with a length of 10 meter, width of 45 meter and a height of 33 meter is covering the gate recess and the other caisson with a length of 67 meter, width of 45 meter and a height of 33 meter is covering the gate chamber. Between the pneumatic caisson an immersible caisson is located. This caisson acts as foundation for the guiding rail and moving equipment and prevents piping below the lock gates. With help of SCIA Engineer, a software package for structural calculations, the structural feasibility of the caisson is analysed and worked out. Due to the lack of bending and torsional stiffness in the first construction alternative the occurring forces and moments are up to 2 times larger in comparison to the second construction alternative. The use of pneumatic caissons to construct the lock head has some advantages over the use of a traditional building pit. The building time of 22 months is 8 months shorter in duration compared with the building pit and the building costs are with respectively Euro 48.300.000 and Euro 37.700.000 much lower than the building costs of a building pit which is estimated at Euro 52.600.000. Moreover the pneumatic caissons can be constructed in controlled conditions above the surface level. Despite of the advantages the construction method has a large number of disadvantages. Different conclusions can be drawn up. Some conclusions are in favor of the construction with pneumatic caisson. On the other hand the construction method has some important disadvantages that can not be neglected. A considerably large working space is required for the sedimentation basin and bentonite de-sanding installation during subsidence of the caisson(s). The possibility of rotation of the caisson during subsidence and working under an overpressure increase the associated risks. It should be taken into account that about 50% of the surface area of the bottom slab must be reinforced against shear. Also a large amount of bending reinforcement (101 kg=m3–219 kg=m3) is required. Moreover there is less practical experience with the construction of pneumatic caissons. A comparison between the options on feasibility, safety, risk, required materials, building time and costs shows that the reference design, the use of a traditional building pit to construct the lock head, is the best conceivable option.","pneumatic caisson; lock; construction method; Terneuzen","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","","","51.329459, 3.819328"

(mentor)","2015","In the Netherlands, green residues such as verge grass are a possible alternative to (partially) replace traditional fossil fuels. A feasible way of doing this, without large modification costs on existing power plants, is biomass co-firing. However, grass has high moisture content, poor grindability properties and high ash content, which have prevented it from being directly co-combusted. Pre-treatments consisting of mechanical dewatering and thermal treatment (torrefaction) could greatly improve the feedstock properties in an energy efficient way. This study firstly investigates the effect of mechanical fractionation on the biomass composition, with focus on the mass losses of carbohydrates, lignin, extractives and inorganic matters during pressing. Secondly, an experimental bench-top, batch torrefaction setup was built. This test rig could provide valuable data from drying and torrefaction experiments, which could be used for modeling purposes and operating experiences for designing a larger-scale torrefaction plant in the future. Also, a preliminary study on the biomass torrefaction behavior was done by analyzing the experimental products. Mechanical dewatering was found to be quite effective for handling herbaceous biomass feedstock as it removes approximately 30% of the moisture; this pre-treatment also improves the biomass quality by removing about half of the inorganic matters, which could cause slagging and fouling problems during combustion. Besides this, chemical analysis incorporating extraction, hydrolysis and High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) showed that pressing had removed about 10wt% of the carbohydrates and 20wt% of acid insoluble lignin. In addition, studies on extractive free samples proved that extractives had a catalytic effect on the thermal reactivity of biomass, which means that removal of extractives could lead to (slightly) higher thermal decomposition temperature. Depending on the process conditions, dried biomass will suffer a 20% - 50% mass loss during torrefaction. Results from the chemical analysis on the torrefied grass had shown the reduction of carbohydrates content at different torrefaction temperatures. The resulted solid product, biochar, has a higher energy density than the primary feedstock and it is easier to store and transport. Also, torrefaction makes the biomass feedstock more brittle and less fibrous, which would benefit the fuel preparation for co-firing.","biomass; co-firing; pre-treatment; mechanical fractionation; torrefaction","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Process and Energy","","Energy Technology","",""

(mentor); Van Polen, F. (mentor)","2015","Keeping maps up to date is quite costly because road geometry changes over time and mapping by professional surveyors is an expensive operation. With the presence of GPS sensors on mobile phones and in most cars today it becomes possible to measure the location of roads with many measurements from sensors of lower accuracy. In this thesis we explored a method to use these less-accurate measurements for the development and maintenance of a dynamic road map. The main research question is: How to create and maintain an accurate and dynamic map based on position traces? --Method-- To answer the main research question, we have developed a quadratic time robust online mapgeneration algorithm (ROMA) for creation a dynamic vector-representation of the world where position signals are gathered. The world and GPS signals were simulated so that an absolute ground truth representation off the world was available. For the evaluation of map quality we developed a cubic time metric which finds a common edge subgraph of the world and the developed map. This subgraph indicates the true positives and enabled us to determine both precision and recall for the generated map. Using the harmonic mean of precision and recall we were able to indicate map quality in one number on the interval [0,1]. We tested the dynamic behaviour of ROMA on scenario’s of road introduction and road removal. --Results-- Each run of the road introduction experiment showed an increase in map quality followed by stabilisation or even a decline in map quality. Map quality generally reached a value of 0.5 within 5 minutes of road introduction. In all experiments the recall was constantly higher than the measured precision. Recall generally reached a maximum of over 0.8 whereas precision stayed at 0.5. For the road removal experiment we introduced roadblocks at the peak of measured map quality for traffic densities showing a clear decline afterwards. Road removal was detected within 30 minutes after the introduction of roadblocks for removal of up to 50% of all roads in the world. All experiments showed a build up of web-like road structures around the location of roads in the world. This build-up was stronger present in experiments with higher traffic densities. --Discussion and conclusion-- This research has provided new insight into incremental map-development by looking at the temporal aspects of the process. Within this research we have provided insight in the formation over time of web-like structures within trace-merging algorithms. Due to the investigation of this phenomenon we have also provided suggestions for the decrease of this effect over time by merging parallel roads. The novel graph based method for map comparison offers advantages to existing approaches and is especially suitable for incremental maps while the road takes shape. ROMA offers a method for dynamic map generation which robustly creates and maintains a map representation of the world through the collection of GPS traces. The experiments show that a navigable map is generated which detects new roads being travelled and also forgets roads no longer travelled. We therefore conclude that ROMA is a decent proof of concept for dynamic vector-map generation in an online fashion.","GIS; map-generation; online; algorithm; graph comparison; MCES; GPS; dynamic; map; proof-of-concept","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Interactive Intelligence","","Computer Science","",""

Polanoschool in Rotterdam, which is an elementary school for deaf and hard-of-hearing children that is part of the Royal Auris Group. The ability to hear varies per pupil and teacher, but some pupils and teachers are not able to hear anything. The school focuses on teaching language skills that are fit to the capabilities of the pupils. To do this effectively, they create an accessible environment for all which is pleasant to work in. The school performs well in this. The only part that is still not accessible in the school experience is the school bell that is used to mark the end of the school breaks. The assignment was to create a visual, attractive and fitting school alarm for the breaks. With a more fitting school alarm, everyone at the school will have the same edge in perceiving. This is important for feeling and becoming self-reliant and also in keeping break- and effective-learning- hours consistent. In the current situation, the metal school bell is rang by a teacher or pupil on the playground. At the same time, the school door bell is rang by a teacher to alarm teachers inside. The ringing of both bells are done on varying times before or even after the exact end time of the break. The reason for this, is that there is not much help in keeping the time while playing or supervising the pupils. When ringing the school bell, the holder makes a round with the bell around the U-shaped playground, where not all parts of the playground are evenly alarmed. The bell itself is visually not salient, acoustically not pleasant and often not effective. The U-shaped form of the playground does not help in creating a visual overview for the pupils and teachers, because school building walls are blocking the view. Different behavior, concerns and levels of attention during the break and the ringing of the bell were found for groups of pupils and teachers. Three main attention patterns towards the school bell could be classified. The ‘observers’ consisting of mostly 7 to 13 year old pupils and the supervising teachers are very attentive and are aware of their surroundings. The ‘excluded’, with mostly deaf pupils and teachers and teachers inside were found to be very attentive too, but they could still miss the alarm because the current signals could not reach them or were too weak. The ‘unwary’, with mostly 3 to 6 year old pupils and multi-impaired pupils know what the bell and bell sign means. Still, they might be too engaged in their play and need more facilitation from a supervising teacher to bring them back from playing. Noticing the alarm at a late time will delay the break up process. And not being time-aware worsens the possibility to notice signals. To tackle this unawareness, the ‘observers’ might benefit from a preparing signal, the excluded from a perceivable signal and the unwary from a non-ignorable signal. To make an alarm that can do all, a momentary one would not be enough. A dynamic alarm is a solution, because it can create time-awareness and urgency among inattentive and attentive pupils and teachers by gradually increasing the intensity and patterns of the signals. Switching to a more dynamic way of warning others will have more chance of being noticed and can be experienced as more fitting and polite to this communal and independent school environment. It could help pupils to become more self-reliant and at the same time decrease the break up time. A central and automatic solution was wished for by the school management so that break times stay accurate and pupils and teachers will be facilitated instead of getting more tasks during the break. A metaphor for the future alarm and how it is experienced, is ‘boarding the train’. The steps of boarding the train are translated to the steps of the future school alarm too. Requirements for the future alarm are being perceivable for all, well controllable in speed, direction and reach, creating time-awareness and urgency and are shareable. A visual alarm was chosen, because the hearing impaired pupils and teachers at the Polanoschool are visually very strong. LED lighting was used to create flashes, contrast difference and movement to catch attention from people even in their visual periphery. Using LED seemed also the most durable of the solutions. The casings and cables that connect to the LED are also able to withstand 10 years of working outside. The final design is called ‘Sign+All’ and is a lighting system consisting of 20 ground spots with RGB LED lighting inside spread over the playground. The spots are placed on places where pupils and teachers often look or can encounter them, so that the signals can never be missed. At the same time, they will placed so that people will not trip over, slip or fall on them. To give a feel for how much time is left before the end of the break, different colors and flashing patterns are used per phase that increase in intensity and speed when the phase is closer to the end of that break. Green shows the remaining break time, yellow-orange that everyone should get back and red color that it is course time. The flashing pattern of the lights clearly marks the end of the break. The casings have a cover and 3 Watt LEDs are used so that the light signals can be visible on sunny days. The lights are wired under the ground and controlled from software on a pc in the school building with DMX (digital multiplexing). This makes the timing accurate and up-to-date when the pc is turned on and off. The total system and the installment can be kept under the set budget. The final design called ‘Sign+All’ is a dynamic school break alarm that makes information about the break times more accessible and helps in getting people back in time for class.","hearing impaired; alarm system; time awareness","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Industrial Design","","Master of Science Design for Interaction","","51.875978, 4.518395"

(mentor); Van Vuren, S. (mentor); Paarlberg, A.J. (mentor); Mosselman, E. (mentor); Havinga, H. (mentor)","2015","Over the last centuries, Dutch rivers such as the Rhine have been heavily trained for the purpose of the safe discharge of water, sediment and ice, and navigability. After the notorious flood events of 1993 and 1995 along the Rhine, new large-scale river works were initiated, such as the Room for the River (RfR) programme, to increase flood conveyance capacity. For a better navigation, in 2006 the minimum guaranteed depth on the Waal has been raised from 2.50 m to 2.80 m (relative to the Agreed Low Water level). It is inevitable that the measures of the large-scale works (depending on the type and magnitude of the measure) and changes in the minimum guaranteed depth will influence the morphology of the river and the dredging effort. Three schematisations are distinguished in this research, namely maintenance dredging in the situation with a minimum guaranteed depth of 2.5 m (‘Ref – 2.5 m’), the situation with a minimum guaranteed depth of 2.8 m (‘Ref – 2.8 m’), and the situation after the implementation of the Room for the River programme (‘RfR’, with a minimum guaranteed depth of 2.8 m). The aim of this research is to determine the impacts of the increase in the minimum guaranteed depth and the Room for the River programme on the maintenance dredging in the river Waal using the deterministic approach (traditional) and a stochastic approach, and to determine the potential of a stochastic approach with respect to the deterministic approach in river management practice. Currently, morphological calculations are being executed using a deterministic approach. The deterministic approach appears to be an effective tool to provide a quick expression of the physical morphodynamic processes. However, to fully acknowledge these morphodynamic processes and to derive a precise illustration using a deterministic model is very complex. By ignoring the complexity of the morphodynamic processes, the involved uncertainties are not made explicit. Identifying the uncertainty in morphodynamic predictions is necessary in order to come to grips with system behaviour of the Waal. Therefore, it is important to not only look at the deterministic calculation, but also to perform stochastic calculations. In this study, numerical calculations with a 2D depth averaged Delft3D model are performed using a deterministic and stochastic approach to determine the bed level changes, navigability, and dredging effort. For the deterministic approach a representative discharge hydrograph is used and for the stochastic approach 75 different discharge time series. From the present research it follows that the maintenance dredging volume in the ‘Ref – 2.8 m’ situation is twice as much as in the ‘Ref – 2.5 m’ situation. It increases drastically with 196%. The increase in the maintenance dredging volume in the ‘RfR’ situation compared to the ‘Ref – 2.8 m’ situation is approximately 10 times lower than the increase in the maintenance dredging volume in the ‘Ref – 2.8 m’ situation (which is related to the dredging effort in the ‘Ref – 2.5 m’ situation). This concludes that the increase of the minimum guaranteed depth has a bigger impact on the maintenance dredging than the impact of the Room for the River measures. According to the simulations it also follows that the dredging volume in all sharp bends (Millingen (rkm 869-870), Erlecom (rkm 875-876) and Nijmegen (rkm 883-885)) in total is more than the half of the total dredging volume on the Waal. Nijmegen (rkm 883-886) only covers more than one-third of the total maintenance dredging volume on the Waal. As regards to the deterministic and the stochastic approach, the differences between the mean value of the stochastic approach and the deterministic approach are rather high in the entire Waal (which lies between 30 and 40%). In the Nijmegen area this difference is negligible. Generally speaking, the mean value of the stochastic approach is not underestimated by the deterministic calculations. The large difference does not imply that the stochastic approach is more promising than the deterministic approach or vice versa. The uncertainty range (90%-confidence band) in the stochastic approach helps the river manager to decide where and how to interfere in the river system and it helps in drawing up performance based contracts with dredging companies. The stochastic approach gives more insight in the range or likelihood of predictions if it comes to dredging. If the river manager wants to employ a dredging company (contractor) for maintenance dredging, he can sign the contract for a lower amount of money, since the mean value of the stochastic approach is lower than the results of the deterministic approach.","room for the River; the Waal; the Rhine river; dredging; recent changes; deterministic approach; probabilistic approach; Monte Carlo Simulation; Delft3D model; Nijmegen","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","Hydraulic structures & Flood risks","",""

The enquiry begins by introducing the model that has been developed to simulate the hydrodynamics of the AUV, including the implementation of water exit and orbital wave, to preview the impact that water-exit and waves have on the dynamics of the vehicle. Secondly, the desired exit velocity and angle of the AUV for a successful jump were determined. It was observed that water exit effects have a large influence on the dynamics of the vehicle. Then, several types of landing platform were compared. It was observed that wave incidence angle; significant wave height; wave period and the type of platform have great impact on the probability of making the jump. The results showed that a jump at an desired exit angle of 60 degrees with a desired exit velocity of 8.6 m/s , with a wave incidence of 90 degrees, and landing on the swimming platform at the aft of a MCMV offered the best chance of a successful landing. An AUV with these specific demands was lastly subjected to different conditions, e.g. several wave significant wave heights and significant wave periods. In this way, the probability of making a successful jump under different environmental conditions was determined to be 73% for the simulated cases which represents 70% of the time.","launch and recovery; water exit; AUV; Autonomous Underwater Vehicle; REMUS100; orbital wave; hydrodynamic","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Marine Technology","","Science Track: Ship Hydrodynamics","",""

(mentor)","2015","This master thesis, “New headrest concept with integrated IFE solution enhancing passengers’ privacy - and in-flight experience” presents a design of a headrest with an integrated In-Flight Entertainment (IFE) system, focused on improving the passenger experience by adding support for the neck area and helping passengers enhance their privacy experience. The initial target was premium economy seats but the concept can also be introduced as a feature for business class seats. The assignment was initially focused on the development of a premium economy seat but because of an Airbus patent the choice was made to continue with the key elements of the chosen seat concept. Allowing the passenger to enhance their privacy perception through an IFE system. Since most of the senses are in the human head a connection with a headrest was quickly made. With the neck and shoulder area as one of the main discomfort areas during flights this was seen as a perfect match. The literature research phase revealed the neck as a problem area with regards to discomfort as well as an opportunity to improve the comfort through a wow experience and a lack of knowledge regarding privacy during air travel. The outcomes were further investigated during explorative user research which confirmed that privacy is considered important during air travel by passengers. The user research also uncovered the user concerns towards aircraft seats which served as input for the rest of the project. With the findings of the literature research phase confirmed, an additional literature research was performed into the topic of privacy in general and in relation to air travel. The results and findings of the different research phases were forged into a vision which determined the course of the rest of the project. Based on the vision numerous ideas were generated which were combined into two concepts. These concepts were judged based on weighted criteria and the Pangolin concept was chosen to continue with. However the Pangolin concept as is was already patented by Airbus who released their patent in August of 2014, making it impossible to continue with the concept. The decision was made to refine the assignment and to continue with the key elements of the concept and combine it with a head rest to reduce discomfort in the neck and shoulder area at the same time. The Retina concept stems from the refined assignment and is the result of a cooperation with Avegant and a second conceptualization phase. The IFE system uses Virtual Retina Display (VRD) technology which partly immerses the users, leaving their peripheral vision free. This should realize in an improved privacy perception and more privacy for business travelers without fully immersing them during the flight. In order to confirm whether the Retina concept meets all the targets set in the refined assignments multiple user test were conducted. Proof of concept was realized with regards to the privacy perception of the users and significant results were discovered with regards to support and discomfort provided by the Retina concept compared to the current headrest-IFE combination. Recommendations and conclusions are presented at the end of this report.","aerospace; seat design; IFE","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Industrial Design","","","",""

This among others is the reason the Cau Hai Lagoon area has a long history of floods and other water related problems. Inhabitants are very dependent on the lagoon, as the main sources of income of people living in the region are fishing, agri- and aquaculture. The project goal has been formulated as follows: Finding an economic as well as technical feasible solution to reduce the water related problems, specifically navigability, salt intrusion and floods, in and around the Cau Hai Lagoon and the Tu Hien inlet and thereby improving the economic development of the region. Concerning flood risk, navigability and salt intrusion the inlet stability and size are important aspects. Using an echo sounder the bathymetry of the inlet has been measured. The measured size of the inlet was one of the input parameters for the hydraulic model that has been set up. This basic model of the Cau Hai basin system was made to test some alternative solutions for the Tu Hien inlet. The different solutions were simulated for five different scenarios. These scenarios include average dry season conditions, average wet season conditions and multiple extreme events. The output of the model for the different alternatives was used to rate the alternatives for a couple of criteria in a Multi Criteria Analysis. Other criteria of the MCA are qualitatively rated. The most promising alternative proved to be the one including a jetty at the northern side of the Tu Hien inlet in combination with a bank protection at the other side. In this way a large part of the littoral drift is blocked, enlarging the equilibrium cross-section of the inlet. This in turn results in a better flood evacuation capacity, navigability and water quality in the lagoon. For both mentioned elements a preliminary technical design is made, resulting in the stone class needed for the armour layers, dimensions of the toe and characteristics of the filter.","Vietnam; Hue; Thua Thien-Hue; inlet stability; flood risk; salt intrusion; water pollution; erosion","en","student report","TU Delft - Faculty of civil engineering","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","","","16.3201395, 107.8637695"

(mentor)","2015","Detecting similarities between (RNA, DNA, and protein) sequences is an important part of bioinformatics. Among the algorithms used to accomplish this, the Smith-Waterman algorithm is very popular. A sequential implementation of Smith-Waterman requires quadratic running time with respect to the length of the sequences. As the amount of data in this field is continuously increasing, quick analysis through a sequential implementation is no longer feasible. One way to reduce the running time is by using parallelism and parallel platforms. There is a great diversity of hardware platforms that enable parallelism in different ways, each favoring different types of computations. The subject of this thesis is to understand the performance of the state-of-the-art parallel implementation of the Smith-Waterman algorithm, PaSWAS, on different parallel hardware platforms. PaSWAS has been designed and implemented using CUDA, the proprietary framework from NVIDIA. This choice limits the PaSWAS functionality to NVIDIA GPUs. By using OpenCL, a platform independent, standard programming model for many-cores, we enable PaSWAS to run in parallel on other hardware platforms. We show that, for NVIDIA GPUs, the portability enabled by OpenCL comes at the expense of performance. We further define a set of platform-specific parameters that have a high performance impact for the OpenCL implementation, and demonstrate empirically that their values are different for different hardware platforms. We also demonstrate that proper partitioning of the sequences can increase parallelism, which leads to better performance. Lastly, we create a performance estimator which is able to predict the execution time of the PaSWAS algorithm on different hardware platforms for given dataset. This enables us to determine a-priori which hardware platform to use for a given dataset. We conclude that PaSWAS is a very effective parallel implementation of the Smith-Waterman algorithm, which delivers excellent results for GPUs (in both CUDA and OpenCL), and can be quite effective on CPUs, too. The performance vs. portability tradeoff of OpenCL is relevant for PaSWAS, and it is ultimately the choice of the end user which of the two is more relevant.","OpenCL; CUDA; Performance estimator; Smith-waterman; Bioinformatics; PaSWAS; Hardware platforms","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2015-03-02","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Parallel and Distributed Systems","","","",""

(mentor); Visser, A.A. (mentor); De Waal, V.H.A. (mentor)","2015","This project was initiated as a way to explore possible applications for dynamic road markings on highways. During rush hour some of the shoulder lanes are opened for traffic. These lanes are known as rush hour lanes (‘spitsstrook’ in Dutch). Matrix signs with green arrows indicate that the road user is allowed to use the lane that is usually only used in case of emergency. To access this lane road users have to cross the thick solid marking. User research on resting areas next to highways was performed to find out if the experience on rush hour lanes differed from regular highways. Using stickers road users were able to express their experiences. Especially the diagonal line marking that the road user has to cross at the beginning of a rush hour lane causes confusion for many road users. The line communicates that the road user should divert suddenly from the lane he or she is driving on, which is in conflict with the matrix signs that indicate that the road user is allowed to drive on the rush hour lane. A concept was proposed that transforms the road image using dynamic road marking. This road marking allows the road marking to be consistent with the current state of the road. When the rush hour lane is open, it will have the same appearance as a regular right lane. In order to change the road layout between the open and closed states, a transition needs to take place. These opening and closing transitions take place while the road is in use, making the road change while the road user is driving on it. In order to design, test and analyze the dynamic road marking concept, a tool was developed. The proposed design changes gradually over the width of the carriageway. The individual road marking elements either fade or morph into a different marking. The concept was tested with 45 participants who drove in the simulator, and experienced part of the rush hour lane in all four states; closed, opening, open, and closing .

(mentor); Baggen, J. (mentor); van de Bor, J. (mentor)","2015","This research focuses on improving the transport modality decision-making process of HEINEKEN NV. More specifically, this research focuses on optimizing the transport from HEINEKEN Nederland Supply to European markets from the perspective of HEINEKEN NV. A large part of the export transport from HEINEKEN Nederland Supply to European markets is organised by truck transport, while often intermodal transport is possible, more environmental friendly and economically feasible. This observation was the incentive to start this research. Investigating the current transport situation led to the following problem statement: The current mode choice in transport from HNS to markets within Europe is made with a strong focus on costs. Other criteria are evaluated during the decision=making process, but only on basis of experience and with limited information about their consequences in the overall distribution process. During this research many affected and involved stakeholders were interviewed. These interviews provided detailed information about the current decision-making process, logistical consequences of modality choices and important transport-related criteria. The detailed description of the current transport-decision making process has been analysed and a preferred future situation was proposed that is in line with the objective of this research: Improve the decision=making process regarding export transport from HNS to European markets. Ensuring continuity and transparency in the decision=making process by the establishment of a quantified and presentable comparison between various transport modality options and their logistical consequences in the warehouses of HNS. The preferred future situation includes all stakeholders of the current situation. The decision-making is performed by the same persons. However, the decision makers are supported by a developed decision-support tool. This decision-support tool has been developed for HEINEKEN in Excel Visual Basic. The tool plots the performance of available transport options using a weighted summation multi-criteria analysis. The transport options are compared on three important criteria: costs, CO2 emissions and transit time. These are all quantified criteria. Costs include the costs of transport, but also include logistical consequences at the warehouses of HEINEKEN Nederland Supply. A modality choice can significantly influence the logistical costs, therefore costs are analysed from a broader perspective. CO2 emissions are related to transport modality and transport route. HEINEKEN wants to reduce CO2 emissions and this can be achieved by optimizing transport choices. A low transit time is important to ensure the freshness of the beer. Furthermore, a low transit time is favourable when un-forecasted peaks in consumption cause high demand peaks. The interviewed stakeholders have given their opinion about the importance of these criteria using the Analytic Hierarchy Process. (Saaty, 1987) The weights that apply to the criteria were derived from the input of all stakeholders. With this method a HEINEKEN NV perspective has been approached. The objective of this research was reached through the development of a weighted summation multi-criteria analysis decision support tool. The decision support tool delivers a quick overview of the performance of transport options on important criteria. Hence, opportunities are more easily identified and decisions are based on quantified criteria. In this way continuity is ensured and transparency is obtained.","","nl","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Marine and Transport Technology","","Transport Engineering and Logistics","",""
