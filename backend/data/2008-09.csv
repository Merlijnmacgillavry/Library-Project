(mentor)","2008","UWB-FM is a low-complexity ultra-wideband (UWB) communication system designed for short-range, low- and medium-data-rate wireless applications such as the personal area network (PAN). These applications often require simple, integrated receivers with low power consumption. Most of previous work utilized delay-line demodulators for UWB-FM detection. This coherent detection method offers the best performance in general but is not necessarily power-efficient. Reported power consumption was around 20 mW for a 2 GHz RF bandwidth. The goal of this research is to explore the possibility of reducing power consumption of a UWB-FM receiver by exploiting the super-regeneration principle. As a result, a fully integrated super-regenerative receiver in IBM 90-nm RF CMOS technology is designed to detect 500 MHz bandwidth UWB-FM signals at 4.5 GHz. Circuit simulations show that a receiver sensitivity of -82.2 dB is attainable for a 100 kbps baseband data-rate and 10^{-6} bit-error-rate. The whole receiver draws an average of 2 mA from a 0.9 V supply. This work is, according to the author's knowledge, the first time the super-regeneration principle is used for UWB-FM detection. The 1.8 mW power dissipation is also by far the smallest among UWB-FM receivers reported in the literature. In addition, the contribution of this work includes an innovative optimization of the quenching waveform for WBFM detection and a novel low-power driven design procedure for LNAs. In conclusion, super-regenerative receivers are promising for short-range, low-data-rate UWB-FM applications, due to their simplicity and low power-consumption.","super-regenerative receiver; low-power; uwb-fm","en","master thesis","TU Delft, Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science, Microelectronics","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","","","","",""

Van","Kleijn, R.J. (mentor); Sauer, U. (mentor); Verheijen, P.J.T. (mentor)","2008","This thesis focuses on the metabolic aspects of cellular adaptation processes to oxidative and iron limiting stresses. These stress conditions are generally encountered by pathogenic species upon the invasion of host organisms. It has attracted the attention of researchers and resulted in the initiation of a European project on Bacillus subtilis systems biology. This project aims at elucidating the regulatory pathways of B. subtilis under oxidative and iron stress for the subsequent application to pathogens. The present study attempts to identify and quantify the adaptations in central carbon metabolism in response to imposed stresses. Therefore a recently developed system of mini-chemostats is used as a culturing system. This setup allows a quick and economic way of culturing under many different conditions. The main finding in oxidative stress adaptations is the re-routing of carbon through the pentose phosphate pathway in order to generate NADPH. NADPH is used by processes that relief the cells of oxidative stress. Next to the production of reduction equivalents, there was an increased amount of extracellular TCA cycle intermediates as fumarate and succinate. The fluxes through this pathway did not change. The iron limitation experiments yielded less clear results on the impact on metabolism. This might be due to the chosen method to deferrate the medium. Deferoxamine caused only minor iron stress and was not life threatening for the cells. That the cells were only slightly affected was shown by the increased production of siderophores, bacterial iron harvesting compounds. The cells were able to survive the situation by the production of siderophores. The results of this study aid the BaSysBio project in obtaining a better understanding of B subtilis adaptation to a shift in environmental conditions. The generated data gives further insight into the adaptation processes and help model development by providing quantitative information on the stress responses. The results can be processed by BaSysBio and can eventually result in new strategies to combat pathogenic bacteria.","Metabolic Engineering; Instrumentation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Applied Sciences","Biotechnology","","Bioprocesstechnology","",""

(mentor); Boermans, L.M.M. (mentor); Breukels, J. (mentor); Ruiterkamp, R. (mentor)","2008","Ram-air wings form an ever increasing market of soft fabric, air inflated wings. They are primairily used in air sports such as parachuting, paragliding and kiting. Ram-air kites may also be used for electric power generation by letting the kite pull a cable from a drum that is connected to a generator. An example if this principle is the Laddermill concept. But since ram-air wings are flexible by nature they will deform and depart from their intended design shape when they are loaded by aerodynamic forces. These deformations generally affect the performance of the wings adversely. Kites with a higher lift-to-drag ratio on the Laddermill could mean a direct increase of the energy produced per square meter of kite. Besides this benefit for the Laddermill there is a huge, world-wide market of parachuting, paragliding and kiting that can benefit from more research and a better understanding of the deformation and aerodynamic performance of ram-air wings. The goals of this thesis are to be able to point out where a ram-air kite departs from the intended design shape, to investigate how well the kite performs, to understand how the deformations affect the airflow and to make suggestions for possible improvements of the design. Since little has been published about these subjects this report will most of all form a basis for further research. This report presents a method to analyse the shape and the aerodynamics of a ram-air kite. The kite is tested in the windtunnel. Its 3D shape is captured using two techniques: photogrammetry and laser scanning. Using the geometry data the structural deformation of the wing is dissected. With computational fluid dynamics the aerodynamics of the deformed shape is analyzed. An extra result of this study is the comparison of photogrammetry and laser scanning in terms of their suitability to capture the 3D shape of the ram-air kite. A number of interesting deformations and flow features were found on the ram-air wing: - Theoretically the bumps (ballooning) and grooves on a ram-air wing hinder the spanwise flow on a 3-dimensional wing, but in practise this effect is only visible on small parts of the upper surface. - The pull of the suspension lines on the under surface and the internal construction of the wing make the upper surface of the wing deform. This results in a decrease of the upper surface curvature, especially near the nose. This curvature decrease causes a loss of lift of at least 5%. - Because the flat, 2-dimensional fabric is inflated into a 3-dimensional shape the fabric wrinkles. The wrinkles continue from the top and bottom surface into the ribs that internally connect and support the top and bottom surface. On average these wrinkles shorten the ribs in chordwise direction by 3.5%. This decreases the surface area of the wing and it makes the ribs effectively thicker. Many more details became visible with the thorough analysis of the wing’s shape. The conclusion is that the performance of the ram-air wing can be improved by changing these details. The photogrammetry measuring technique gave better results than laser scanning and is very suitable tool to make these details visible. It allows a designer to identify where the real flying shape deviates from the design shape. This can help kite designers and designers of other ram-air wings to reverse-","ram air wing; performance; deformation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","","","","",""

(mentor); NXP Semiconductors (contributor)","2008","New generations wireless communication systems require linear efficient RF power amplifiers for higher data transmission rates. However, conventional RF power amplifiers are normally designed for peak efficiency under maximum output power condition. Consequently, when the power is backed-off from its maximum point, the amplifier efficiency drops sharply. As a result, the mean amplifier efficiency is much lower than the efficiency at peak power level. The Chireix outphasing power amplifier is one of the most promising techniques that can simultaneously provide high efficiency and high linearity. Such approach was the origin of the term LINC (LInear amplification using Nonlinear Components), a technique that allows the power amplifiers to continuously operate at their peak power efficiency while providing an almost undistorted output signal. In this project, a Chireix outphasing amplifier for 2.14 GHz with load compensation has been fabricated using GaN HEMTs delivered by CREE. A considerable efficiency improvement has been achieved. The simulation result shows that the drain efficiency of 74% is obtained at 49 dBm peak output power, and the efficiency is kept above 55% over 10 dB power back-off range. The drain efficiency of 70% is measured at 48.5 dBm output power. To meet an increasing demand for wireless communication terminals to handle multi-band multi-mode operation, multi-band multi-mode power amplifiers are urgently needed. An investigation into how to implement multi-band Chireix's outphasing amplifiers has been carried out. Two proposals for implementing potential dual-band Chireixâs amplifiers have been presented. In addition, a comparison of the efficiency under the condition of static load modulation has been made between GaN HEMT devices and LDMOS devices. The result of the comparison is that GaN HEMT devices conspicuously outperform LDMOS devices in terms of drain efficiency under static load modulation.","power amplifier; chireix; linc; load compensation; load modulation","en","master thesis","TU Delft, Electrical Engineering, Mathematics, Computer Sci, Microelectronics","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","","","","",""

(mentor); Soeter, J.P. (mentor)","2008","A key factor in making a shopping center a success, one that should be considered from the start of the development, is the management. The shopping center management is responsible for carrying out the concept of the shopping center and adjusting it, if necessary, to the needs of changing society. The internationalisation and strong shopping center growth across Europe increases the competitiveness in local markets between retail areas attracting consumers. This demands an integral approach to shopping center management to supply and ensure a high quality of the services. The difficulties of operating across the borders of the home market, are the differences between the countries on all levels. To make the research feasibility in the time allotted for the research, it is narrowed down to the countries Portugal, Poland and the Netherlands. The main research question is: 'Which adaptations should be made to the integral approach of shopping center management to make it applicable in Portugal, the Netherlands and Poland?' Theory: Generally, in shopping center, tenants are required to pay a monthly base rent and a percentage of turnover rent agreed upon by both parties. An increase of sales turnover will lead to improved rents, an incentive to the investor, and loyalty of retailers and consumers (ICSC, 1999 p.19). The investor is now more involved in the functioning of the shopping center and will therefore try to better all-round performance in the long run. The vertical integration in the real estate industry creates a synergy between the different businesses levels. The knowledge and the network of the developer is combined with the accessible capital of the investors who also brought a higher level of analysis and evaluation of shopping centers to optimise the resources and improve net operating income with shopping center management. Through globalisation the behaviour of consumers has become steadily more similar. This made it more attractive and easier for retailers to operate outside the borders of their home markets, which resulted in an increase of demand for modern retail space. Municipalities know retail has the ability to change places in desirable international locations for new businesses and are willing to supply land. These three components work as a catalyst in the process of the growing market of shopping centers. The role of shopping center management has become more critical as the competition in the retail market increases. Shopping centers need to control and maintain their position in the market. The integral approach of shopping center management tries to accomplice a competitive advantage with the services commercial, financial and marketing. The functional quality of a shopping center depends highly on desirability of tenant/merchandise mix. The commercial service assists tenants and adjusts the tenant/merchandise mix to serves the changing needs of the local consumers with the information provided by the analysis of the financial service. A flexible lease, in terms of 10-year for anchor tenants and 5-years for smaller tenants with no termination and no prolongation options for the tenants, will provide more options for the management to do this. A comprehensive marketing program is set up from the start of the development to create, maintain and extent the image, because an image is a critical determination of the way customers respond to center. The shopping center management and the tenants participate in a marketing program that promotes he individual stores as well as the shopping center as a whole. Sufficient budgets are needed to supply the integral approach to shopping center management for given periods of time.","shopping center management; Poland; Portugal; Netherlands; shopping center development","en","master thesis","TU Delft, Architecture, Real Estate & Housing","","","","","","","","Architecture","","","","",""

Through this procedure, the building gets a second chance to be revived by being suitably renovated and adjusted to the new function. The specific process of a building's preservation through the alteration of its function has to be implemented in every stage under careful consideration. This is necessary in order to be able to enhance the concept of preservation to a maximum: the protection and continuation of these features of the building that render it so unique for the given country. The Klokkenberg, a complex of buildings in this case, is a sample of characteristic architecture that has been already recognised as provincial monument in the Netherlands and is in the process of recognition as a national monument. The revival of the complex is since 2006 actively on the table of discussion thanks to the new plans of Vitalis Zorg Groep of transforming the once sanatorium to a luxurious Living and care complex for elderly people. The plans of the redevelopment visualise the complex to transform into a luxurious self-standing “village”, which will give the opportunity to the residents to be independent to the maximum.

For this reason, user interfaces have to cope with the complexity of both the application and the users. Furthermore, user interface design is an expensive, complex, and time consuming process. Specifying the appearance of web applications is too low-level due to a lack of good abstractions. This results in undesired style diversity throughout the web application and a lot of style duplication, making the web application dif?cult to maintain and decreasing reusability. This thesis shows an approach to overcome these problems by separating the various user interface concerns and addressing them separately. This is done by developing language extensions for the speci?cation of layout and style and by separating presentation from document structure. The language extensions aim to achieve separation of concerns while still having an integrated language with static veri?cation. Furthermore, web applications are commonly styled using Cascading Style Sheets (CSS). CSS suffers from a number of shortcomings such as missing and excessive functionality and poor design.

(mentor); Van Leeuwen, P.J. (mentor)","2008","The interior of Europa, one of the moons in the Jovian system, is still mainly unknown. There are, however, indications that below an icy outer layer a subsurface ocean is present. Moreover, it has been estimated that in total the ice and ocean are between 80 and 170 kilometers thick. Concerning the thickness of the ice layer, there exist two hypotheses: some believe this layer is relatively thin (up to approximately ten kilometers), whereas others think the ice layer will be much thicker. Since it is expected that the global deformation rate of Europa, caused by the gravity pull of Jupiter, gives insight in the interior of this moon, it is of great interest to investigate this by means of computational models. The main question to be answered in this thesis is: how does the subsurface ocean of Europa deform, due to the tidal pull of Jupiter? To answer this question, the tidal forcing by Jupiter is determined. This tidal potential can be subdivided in a constant tidal potential and a time varying part. Only the latter results in an exchange in tidal energy and time-varying deformation and is, therefore, of interest. The global deformation of Europa due to this time-varying forcing is studied by means of the normal mode analysis. For this analysis, it is assumed that Europa consists of four coupled homogeneous layers; the core, the mantle, the ocean and the sea ice layer. From the normal mode analysis it followed that the radial deformation of Europa in the absence of an ocean, is less than one meter, whereas this deformation is approximately 20 meters if an ocean is present. From these results it can be concluded that by measuring the actual global deformation, for instance by means of future satellite measurements, the presence of an ocean can be determined. The next step is to model the ocean by means of the MIT General Circulation Model (MITgcm), a model that was originally developed for Earth. In this model, the ocean is no longer assumed to be homogeneous. Without sea ice, an ocean of 100 kilometers deep radially deforms approximately 20 meters due to the time-varying tidal potential. In case of an ocean with a depth of 100 kilometers and a sea ice layer with a thickness of ten kilometers, the Europan surface still radially deforms approximately 20 meters, from which it follows that the sea ice layer does not reduce the ocean deformation, i.e. the sea ice acts fluidly. This was also obtained from the normal mode analysis. Furthermore, it follows that the tidal forcing disturbs the geostrophic balance in the ocean and that the ocean dynamics, due to the tidal forcing are driven by the vertical velocities. Since the mantle is also subject to tidal deformation, heat will also be generated in this layer. On Io, for instance, volcanoes are present and it is therefore reasonable to assume that volcanoes are also present on the ocean floor of Europa. These volcanoes release the tidal heat from the mantle in the ocean. Consequently, the sea ice experiences extra heating, which leads to additional melting. This may be a strong argument for the thin sea ice hypothesis. In addition, it is shown that the shallower the ocean, the higher the ocean velocities. Thus, the presence of subsurface volcanoes and, for example, ridges will locally result in higher ocean velocities. It may well be the case that these disturbances in the velocity field and the heat released by volcanoes result in melt troughs and produce the characteristic cracks visible on the Europan surface.","Jovian moon; ocean dynamics; tidal motion","en","master thesis","TU Delft, Aerospace Engineering, Astrodynamics and Satellite Systems","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","","","","",""

(mentor)","2008","Bijna alle stalen boogbruggen bestaan uit twee bogen die aan weerszijden van het brugdek staan. Om stabiliteit tegen knik uit het vlak van deze bogen te waarborgen worden deze bogen in de praktijk door middel van dwarsverbandstaven met elkaar verbonden. Deze verbandstaven hebben geen invloed op de primaire krachtsafdracht van de boogbrug en dienen enkel als stabiliteitselementen. De vraag rijst nu echter of deze dwarsverbanden niet net als de onderdelen van het brugdek aan veelvuldige spanningswisselingen en daarmee ook aan vermoeiing onderhevig zijn. Stalen boogbruggen zijn namelijk in bijna alle gevallen verkeersbruggen en krijgen daarom tijdens hun ontwerplevensduur te maken met miljoenen spanningswisselingen. Om een antwoord op de vraag te geven of de dwarsverbanden onderhevig zijn aan vermoeiing moet eerst worden onderzocht hoe groot de momenten zijn die in de dwarsverbanden optreden. Dit is in dit verslag onderzocht voor een vijftal belastinggevallen, te weten: belasting op de gehele brug, belasting over de halve brug (in lengterichting), belasting op de halve brug (op een hoofdligger), kruiselingse belasting en kwartbelasting. Daarnaast is ook onderzocht wat de invloed van verschillende dwarsverbandconfiguraties op de momenten in de verbanden is. Hiervoor zijn een vijftal dwarsverbandconfiguraties gemodelleerd, te weten: de rechte dwarsverbandconfiguratie, de kruis- dwarsverbandconfiguratie, de kruis- dwarsverbandconfiguratie met additionele rechte verbandstaven en de K- dwarsverbandconfiguratie. Met deze scala aan configuraties is het gehele spectrum afgedekt wat in de realiteit van toepassing is. Als laatste is onderzocht wat de invloed van de afmeting van de dwarsverbandstaven op de optredende momenten is. Hiervoor is de afmeting van de dwarsverbandstaven proportioneel gesteld aan het traagheidsmoment van de boogligger. Er zijn modellen gemaakt waarin de dwarsverbandstaven een traagheidsmoment van 5%-35% van het traagheidsmoment van de boogligger hebben. Dit is in stappen van 5% onderzocht. Daarmee is een totaal van 7 dwarsverbandafmetingen onderzocht. Als model is de Nootdorpspoorbrug voor over de A12 bij Nootdorp gebruikt. Deze is in het EEM- pakket MIDAS Civil gemodelleerd. Uit het onderzoek is gebleken dat er momenten in drie richtingen in de dwarsverbanden optreden; moment y, moment z, (torsie)moment x. Deze momenten worden met stijgende afmeting van de verbandstaven steeds groter. Dit is een bijna lineair verband. Tevens bleek dat de momenten een gemiddelde waarde van ca. 200-300kNm hebben, en daarmee 20%-40% van de optredende momenten in de boogligger bedragen. Tevens bleek dat de kruiselingse belastingconfiguratie het ongunstigst voor de gegenereerde momenten is. De dwarsverbandconfiguratie met het grootste materiaalverbruik en tevens de grootste stijfheid, de kruis- rechte- configuratie bleek gemiddeld het gunstigst te zijn, en de laagste momenten te veroorzaken. Concluderend kan men dus stellen dat het zeker aandacht verdient om de dwarsverbandstaven op vermoeiingssterkte te testen.","arch bridge","nl","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Design and Construction","","Structural and Building Engineering","",""

Computer architectures based on reconfigurable hardware are becoming more popular now that classical drawbacks are diminishing. FPGA are constantly improving in terms of performance and area, and provide a technology platform that allows fast and complex reconfigurable designs. The MOLEN polymorphic processor provides the possibility of executing an application-specific core in a custom generated hardware unit, which resides inside a reconfigurable fabric. This thesis presents the architectural design and implementation of a reconfigurable and extensible open source VLIW processor: ?-VEX. In addition to architectural extensibility, our processor also supports reconfigurable operations. Furthermore, we present an application development framework to optimally exploit the freedom of reconfigurable operations. Because ?-VEX is based on the VEX ISA, we already have a good compiler which is able to deal with ISA extensibility and reconfigurable operations. Our processor is targeted to be a CCU within a MOLEN reconfigurable computing machine. To estimate the performance gains, we present a performance analysis based on the VEX simulator. Results of benchmarks on real hardware show that different configurations of our processor in a stand-alone environment lead to considerable cycle count reductions for a selected benchmark application. 1-, 2-, and 4-issue ?-VEX configurations were synthesized and implemented in real hardware to operate at a maximum clock frequency of 89 MHz.","vliw; vex; processor; fpga; molen","en","master thesis","TU Delft, Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science, Computer Engineering","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","","","","",""

The numerical solving is performed with a non-commercial FORTRAN77 code, based on the finite volume method with a second order central differencing scheme (CDS). The blood is modelled as an incompressible homogeneous Newtonian fluid. As a result, it is found that the magnetic field can create and influence the size of recirculations in the mainstream and also creates significantly large secondary motions.

However, communication with computers is still done by keyboard and mouse. In this human-computer interaction there is no room for emotions, whereas if we would communicate with machines the way we do in face-to-face communication much information can be extracted from the context and emotion of the speaker. We have proposed a protocol for the construction of a multimodal database and a prototype that can be trained on this database for multimodal emotion recognition. The multimodal database consists of audio and videos clips for lip reading, speech analysis, vocal affect recognition, facial expression recognition and multimodal emotion recognition. We recorded these clips in a controlled environment. The purpose of this database is to make it a benchmark for the current and future emotion recognition studies in order to compare the results from different research groups. Validation of the recorded data is done online. Over 60 users scored the apex images (1.272 ratings), audio clips (201 ratings) and video clips (503 ratings) on the valence and arousal scale. Textual validation is done based on Whissellâs Dictionary of Affect in Language. A comparison is made between the scores of all four validation methods and the results showed some clusters for distinct emotions, but also some scatter for certain emotions which depend mainly on the context. Context is not always available. We created a prototype that can extract and track the facial feature points, this prototype is based on the system of Anna Wojdel. The prototype is designed in Matlab and is able to separate the audio from the video clip, extract frames and perform 5 different classifiers on the audio and video stream separately. For the auditory channel we have trained three classifiers: one for all 21 emotions, one for positive and negative emotions and one for active and passive emotions. For the visual channel we have trained two classifiers: one based on the found facial feature points and one based on AU activation. The classification results from our prototype are promising, considering we have 21 different emotions and trained the auditory classifiers on two persons and the visual classifiers on one person. Better results can be established if we have access to more samples from various people.","multimodal; emotion; recognition; recording; validating","en","master thesis","TU Delft, Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science, Media and Knowledge Engineering","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","","","","",""

(mentor)","2008","We propose a method for identifying segments of a video that represent the events preferred by the user. Possible applications are personalized browsing through music DVDs or smart surveillance systems that can adapt to new circumstances. Requirements for this system are that it is generic and adaptable to the user and to new circumstances. Interactive learning techniques meet these requirements. Interactive learning methods are machine learning methods that involve the user in the learning process in some way. Interactive learning methods do not need information about the problem beforehand and make a system adaptable. For these reasons we propose to apply interactive learning techniques to video content analysis. We chose to implement a user interface that allows users to indicate the relevance of parts of a video by adapting a curve. This curve is used for labelling the underlying audio feature vectors to use as a training set for a classifier. The scenario in which a user adapts a relevance curve while watching a video turned out to be a good way of interacting with the user. The scenario implicates some restrictions for the system, that have turned out to be very strict for the classifier. This classifier needs to be capable of learning efficiently from different sized training sets, handling unbalanced datasets, handling problems with different complexities and not take too much training and classification time. The key findings with respect to our music DVD test scenario are: • Choices about the best classifier and its parameters without any information about events or data can not be optimized because of the lack of prior information. • Support Vector (SV) classifiers need extensive parameter optimization in order to get good results; no optimization means bad results in general and optimizing based on the (small) training set is very time-consuming and can cause overfitting. Because of the constraints in the SV algorithm, this classifier might not handle highly overlapping classes well. These reasons make a SV classifier not a suitable choice for our application. • A Nearest Neighbour (NN) classifier, adapted in such a way that the prior probabilities are taken into account, gave the best overall results on our data. This can be explained by the fact that this classifier has no heavy parameter tuning to perform. • Unbalanced datasets do not have to pose a problem as classifiers can be adapted and post processed to use this information. This same adaptation strategy can be applied for classes that have different classification costs. • User feedback can be used in an 'active learning' manner: Hard to classify samples are labelled and these can be stressed in order to focus more on these samples for better results. To adapt this to surveillance videos the following steps need to be taken: • A general video feature set needs to be chosen and, if necessary, combined with the audio feature set. • Sub sampling needs to be implemented so the system can 'forget' old samples and this way adapt to new circumstances. • The first training is best performed on an offline database or by attaching it to an existing system. This will reduce the training time that is expected to be high because at least a few examples of threat situations need to be labelled, while these situations are rare. Interactive learning is a promising concept to be applied to video concept detection. This thesis analyses the possibilities and restrictions of applying interactive learning to our scenario.","interactive learning; video","en","master thesis","TU Delft, Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science, Information and Communication Technology (ICT)","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","","","","",""

The revetment consists of polyurethane bonded aggregate. A two-component polyurethane adhesive is added to and mixed with narrow graded mineral aggregate. The mixture is then cast in-situ on the dike surface, where hardening takes place. The individual rocks are fixed together only at their contact points, so that the natural porosity of the aggregate is maintained. During the storm season of 2007-2008 the two pilot locations were inspected on a regular basis. Damage observations were done visually and material loss out of several control areas was quantified. Though the storm season counted several periods with strong winds and high waves, both pilots survived with only negligible and superficial damage. During the most extreme conditions, the Eastern-Scheldt pilot was persistently subjected to high flow velocities and the most unfavourable form of wave loading on a dike slope, namely plunging and collapsing waves. The pilot along the North-Sea coast was mostly submerged, resulting in attack by strong bed flow velocities, with water containing high concentrations of abrasive material (sand and shell fragments). With the pilots, the polymer revetment proved able to withstand typical Dutch storm conditions and also valuable experience in constructing with this new material was gained.","elastocoast; polymer; revetment; pilot; Netherlands","en","master thesis","TU Delft, Civil Engineering and Geosciences, Hydraulic Engineering","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","","","","",""

De ontwikkeling van BIM gaat snel in Nederland en daarbuiten. Meerdere organisaties houden zich bezig met de implementatie of promotie van BIM. Strukton is één van de voorlopers in Nederland die BIM wil toepassen. Theoretisch is BIM deels mogelijk, maar de praktijk blijft achter. De invoering van BIM verloopt moeizaam. De versnippering en projectgestuurde aanpak in een bouwproject maken informatieoverdracht tussen de projectpartners van essentieel belang. In de huidige situatie wordt informatie vastgelegd in 2D technische tekeningen en overgedragen op (digitaal) papier. De traditionele informatieoverdracht is inefficiënt, foutgevoelig en leidt tot waardeverlies. Een betere informatieoverdracht kan worden verkregen door BIM. BIM is het proces van informatie toevoegen aan een digitale objectgeoriënteerde representatie van een bouwproject. Centraal in BIM is het BIM-model waaraan in een ideaal geval alle projectpartners tegelijk werken zodat de partners over de juiste en up-to-date informatie beschikken. Consequenties van wijzigingen zijn dan direct zichtbaar voor alle partners. Het principe van BIM is niet nieuw, maar afgekeken van andere industrieën, zoals de automobiel- en vliegtuigindustrie. Hoewel de bouwsector wezenlijk anders is, kan de technologie uit de meer procesgerichte sectoren ook in de bouw voor verbeteringen zorgen. De implementatie van BIM in de bouw wordt onder andere gestimuleerd door de ontwikkeling van meerdere BIM-software. Met BIM-software is het mogelijk een deel van het BIM-model te modelleren. In de versnipperde bouw zijn voor de diverse projectpartners verschillende BIM-software beschikbaar. De software ondersteunt slechts een deel van het gehele BIM-model. Noodzakelijk is het uitwisselen van gedeeltelijke BIM-modellen tussen de projectpartners. In de praktijk is nauwelijks ervaring met het uitwisselen van gedeeltelijke BIMmodellen. Ook richtlijnen ontbreken. De probleemstelling van het afstudeerproject is: Op welke wijze kunnen (delen van) BIM-modellen worden uitgewisseld tussen projectpartners met verschillende BIM-software? De gedeeltelijke BIM-modellen komen overeen met de nformatiestromen tussen de projectpartners.

This thesis work is a step towards improving this. By designing, implementing and evaluating a system for Enterprise Information Retrieval, with an improved search result presentation technique, which assists users during search tasks. This was accomplished by researching current ES systems and search result presentation techniques. This research resulted in finding two forms of document summaries, namely a textual document summary technique: Top Ranking Sentences (TRS) and a visual document summary technique: Thumbnails. These document summaries have been designed to support a user during information seeking activity. The system developed was named Basora Enterprise Search (BES) and was developed using an agile software development approach. It incorporates the TRS and Thumbnail into its search result presentation technique. The BES prototype was put through both a performance and user evaluation. The first test indicated that BES performs more or less equal to the Commercial Enterprise Search Solution IBM Omnifind 8.5, while providing the user with two extra forms of document summaries. The user evaluation focussed on evaluation the effectiveness of the new search result presentation technique. The results of the user evaluation show that there are various search tasks where the addition of these summary elements has a positive effect on relevance assessment and query reformulation. This research indicates that the BES system actually helps a user assess the relevance of a document, minimizing the amount of documents that need to be opened before the user finds the desired one. It also indicates that the additional visual and textual document summaries assist the user when reformulating a search query, decreasing the time it takes a user to complete a search task.","enterprise search; search result visualization","en","master thesis","TU Delft, Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science, Media and Knowledge Engineering","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","","","","",""

Since the turn of the 1990’s, Asian countries have started to get involved as well in the race for the skies and have even become the leading contestants of today. Driven by their fast economic growth these contestants want to promote their country and its cities by constructing ever taller skyscrapers. An example of this is the Burj Dubai. With a height well over 800 metres, it will become world’s tallest skyscraper. But, how long can this race for the skies continue? Will we eventually encounter insuperable difficulties which will bring the race to a close? This brings us to the goal of this thesis: ""To gain a good insight into the challenges which will be encountered when designing and constructing an ultra-tall skyscraper, with the aim to find the ultimate limit to the height of the skyscraper."" The thesis’ goal consists of two parts; in the first part of the thesis a clear understanding of the subject is obtained by carefully examining the encountered challenges. In the second part, this knowledge is used to explore the limits to high-rise. A list of 14 challenges is examined. These challenges vary from structural and serviceability challenges to safety and economical challenges. From this list, six challenges are selected which are examined more carefully: the building’s foundation, the skyscraper’s load-bearing structure, the comfort criterion, the vertical transportation of people, goods and building services, evacuating the building’s occupants and the economical feasibility of the skyscraper. First, the limits to each of these challenges are determined by taking into account the Dutch building codes. Secondly, it is examined which measures can be taken to further stretch these limits. These possible measures can be depicted in a web diagram. From this diagram can be noted that one single measure can simultaneously stretch the limit of several challenges. From the diagram follows as well that changing the shape of the skyscraper is one of the most promising measures to stretch the height of the building. Three different options for changing the shape of the skyscraper are examined in the thesis: change the footprint of the building, give the building a tapering shape or create a compound structure, which means that multiple slender towers are interconnected to form one structural entity. After examining these three options it can be concluded that compound structures are the most promising solution if we want to build ultra-tall skyscrapers in the near future. Compound structures perform well all along the line. In the thesis all of the building’s boundary conditions are determined on beforehand. Based on these assumptions the skyscraper’s limits are established. As a result of this, no absolute limit to high-rise can be found. This master’s thesis can be a starting point for future master’s theses. When one wants to further explore the limits to high-rise, it is advised to apply a different approach. The height of the skyscraper should be predetermined. Based on this target one can deduce which structure is needed to achieve this height and which concessions have to be made with regard to the building’s serviceability and safety.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Design and Construction","","","",""

(mentor)","2008","De Rotterdamse haven is één van de grootste havens van de wereld. Om te kunnen concurreren met andere Europese havens is de bereikbaarheid over weg en over water van groot belang. De bereikbaarheid over de weg staat echter onder druk. De autosnelweg A15 is de ontsluitingsweg van de haven, maar door de dagelijks terugkerende files en het hoge aantal incidenten treden er lange vertragingen op en zijn reistijden onbetrouwbaar. Het Havenbedrijf Rotterdam en Rijkswaterstaat maken plannen om op vele fronten de bereikbaarheid van de haven te verbeteren. Eén van middelen die zij hiervoor inzetten is dynamisch verkeersmanagement. Het doel van dynamisch verkeersmanagement is het beter benutten van de bestaande infrastructuur. Routegeleiding is een mogelijkheid om de infrastructuur beter te benutten. Door een deel van het verkeer tijdens congestie via een alternatieve route te leiden kan de gemiddelde vertraging worden gereduceerd. Er zijn geen alternatieve routes voor de A15 beschikbaar via andere autosnelwegen. Daarom is onderzocht of het omleiden van verkeer via het onderliggend wegennet in de A15 corridor mogelijkheid biedt tot verbetering van de verkeerssituatie. In dit onderzoek is een regeltactiek ontwikkeld, die op basis van de reistijd op hoofd en alternatieve route verkeer via het onderliggend wegennet leidt. Hierbij is onderscheid gemaakt tussen vracht- en personenverkeer. Doordat deze twee gebruikersklassen verschillende bestemmingen hebben, zijn er verschillende alternatieve routes gebruikt. Wanneer de routes voor de verschillende gebruikersklassen gebruik maken van dezelfde wegen, is prioriteit gegeven aan het omleiden van vrachtverkeer. Hiervoor is gekozen omdat de onzekerheid over de reistijd een grote kostenpost vormt voor de vrachtvervoerders. De regeltactiek heeft als doel het aantal overschrijdingen van de verwachte reistijd te reduceren. De gemiddelde gerealiseerde reistijd over een langere periode is hierbij gehanteerd als de verwachte reistijd. In de perioden waarin vrachtverkeer geen gebruik maakt van een alternatieve route, wordt personenverkeer volgens een gebruikersoptimum verdeeld over de hoofd en alternatieve route. De regeltactiek is getest in het simulatiemodel Vissim. Het gebruik van een simulatiemodel biedt de mogelijkheid verschillende scenario’s te testen. Behalve de huidige situatie, is de huidige situatie met regeltactiek en een uitgebreide situatie met regeltactiek gesimuleerd. De uitbreidingen in het laatste scenario zijn een capaciteitsuitbreiding van het onderliggend wegennet ter plaatse van de alternatieve routes. De resultaten van de simulaties laten zien dat de toepassing van de regeltactiek niet tot significante verbetering leidt. De gemiddelde vertraging per voertuig blijft gelijk in de drie scenario’s. De gemiddelde filelengte is ter plaatse van de twee belangrijkste bottlenecks, Spijkenisse en A4, teruggedrongen, maar zeer beperkt. Het aantal vrachtwagens dat de verwachte reistijd overschrijdt is weliswaar gereduceerd, maar de reductie uitgedrukt in de totale overschrijdingstijd laat wederom zien dat van een serieuze verbetering geen sprake is. De volgende twee punten zijn hiervoor de belangrijkste oorzaak: - Brugopeningen Botlekbrug - Reistijden onderliggend wegennet De belangrijkste bottleneck in de A15 corridor is de afrit Spijkenisse, na de Botlektunnel. Om op dit punt een alternatieve route te bieden, moet gebruik gemaakt worden van de Botlekbrug. Deze brug gaat meer dan 2 keer per uur, gemiddeld 6 minuten open. Hierdoor wordt de capaciteit van de alternatieve routes die over deze brug voeren aanzienlijk beperkt. Daarnaast is het onderliggend wegennet maar in zeer beperkte perioden een alternatief, wanneer hoofd en alternatieve route vergeleken worden op basis van reistijd. Enerzijds komt dit door de maximum toegestane snelheid, anderzijds doordat de alternatieve routes langer zijn dan de hoofdroutes. In de huidige situatie wordt de capaciteit van de infrastructuur in de A15 corridor al vrijwel volledig benut. In dit onderzoek is één toepassing van dynamisch verkeersmanagement getest. Het blijkt dat om tot een optimale benutting te komen, de inzet van 1 toepassing niet voldoende is. Voor toekomstig onderzoek is het interessant een combinatie van verschillende toepassingen te testen. De bruggenproblematiek zal in de toekomst blijven bestaan, ondanks dat de Botlekbrug verbreed en verhoogd wordt. Het plan is om het verkeer met bestemming Spijkenisse over deze nieuwe brug te voeren, in plaats van door de Botlektunnel. Vanwege de toenemende verkeersvraag op de Oude Maas zal dit tot congestie problemen leiden en zeer waarschijnlijk tot langere reistijd dan de huidige reistijd naar Spijkenisse. Een onderzoek naar de haalbaarheid van dit plan wordt dan ook aanbevolen.","","nl","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Transport & Planning","","","",""

The motivation for this thesis project is the intention of lowering the fairway channel to increase the navigable depth, to create a cost-effective fairway for the bauxite and alumina transport activities. To obtain the navigable depth, the fairway has to be dredged at the shallow locations in the fairway channel. For the investing companies and the contracting companies it is important to know in advance what the amount of sedimentation rate will be in the lowered fairway after capital dredging. The sedimentation rate of the lowered fairway channel will define the feasibility of the whole dredging project on the long term. This study focussed on the mud dynamics in the Suriname River and the effect of lowering the fairway to increase the navigability. This study will focus only on a particular section of the Suriname River Estuary, between Nieuw Amsterdam (km 42) and Paranam (km 87). To achieve the goal of this thesis project, the available measurement data is used to describe the physical elements of the Suriname River Estuary, which are considered important for the sediment transport. To classify which processes influence the mud concentrations and which processes dominate the mud transport in a numerically way, first measurement data of the tidal movements, velocity measurements and salt concentrations are analysed. Analyzing the data resulted in recognizing several hydrodynamic processes, which are potentially dominant for the mud transport in the Suriname River Estuary. The computer tool Delft3D is used for further analysis of the hydrodynamic and morphodynamic processes, plus the estimation of the morphological development of the present situation and the effect of lowering the fairway. According to the Delft3D model results it is clear that the effect of the sediment and salt density on the fluid mixture in the Suriname River Estuary is important for the cumulative sediment transport. The four most important processes that influence the cumulative sediment transport are: tidal asymmetry, gravitational circulation, damped turbulence and the residual river discharge. These processes are included in the simulation within the model, resulting in a balance in sediment transport during one spring-neap cycle of 15 days. Extreme conditions such as extraordinary high tidal amplitude (extreme spring condition), very low river discharges or extreme supply of muddy sediments from the Ocean side could be a reason for an occasional import of sediment in the study area. Lowering the fairway channel hardly influences the balance of the sediment transport processes. The change of the cross section is too small to impact the sediment transport balance on the long term. The width of the fairway channel compared to the width of the entire river is negligible small. The consolidation of the settled sediments was not able to be simulated with the Delft3D-FLOW module. The settling and consolidation strongly influences the erodibility of the sediment bed. Implementing the consolidation process should significantly improve the erosion and sedimentation pattern of the muddy river estuary simulation. Implementing the consolidation process should also include the presence of fluid mud at the bed of the river estuary. Possible density cross current of fluid mud could be an explanation for the dispersion of mud over the entire cross section in stead of deposits at the shallow sections at the river banks.","Suriname; river; estuary; mud; fairway","en","master thesis","TU Delft, Civil Engineering and Geosciences, Hydraulic Engineering","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","","","","",""

(mentor); Wilders, P. (mentor)","2008","Bij het modelleren van rivieren leveren de bochten over het algemeen een uitdaging. Deze vormen dan ook uitstekend testmateriaal voor een model. Al jaren maakt Rijkswaterstaat in verschillende projecten gebruik van het modelleringspakket SIMONA. Dit is een eindige-volume modelpakket gebaseerd op de shallow-water-equations, bedoeld voor het modelleren van gebieden die in verhouding tot het stroomgebied relatief ondiep zijn. Het pakket SIMONA wordt voornamelijk gebruikt voor het modelleren van grote rivieren, meren en zeeen. Om de toepasbaarheid van dit pakket op kleine meanderende rivieren te onderzoeken is het pakket uitgeprobeerd op een riviersegment uit de Dommel. De gemaakte modellen zijn gebaseerd op de meetgegevens uit ""Main flow velocity in short and sharply curved river bends"", DeVriend en Geldof (1983). Meanderende rivieren kunnen doorgaans niet op een rechtlijnig rooster gemodelleerd worden. Daarom dient het riviergebied door een orthogonaal kromlijnig rooster beschreven te worden. In de praktijk wordt gebruik gemaakt van quasi-orthogonale roosters. SIMONA rekent alleen met de orthogonale componenten en verwaarloost de niet-orthogonale componenten. Voor een kwalitatief goed model is het dus zaak de orthogonaliteitsafwijking van het rooster zo klein mogelijk te houden. Voor het genereren van quasi-orthogonale roosters kan gebruik gemaakt worden van conforme afbeeldingen, elliptische roostergeneratie en verschillende variationele methoden. Aan de hand van de orthogonaliteitskwaliteit in de twee opeenvolgende bochten worden enkele van deze methoden met elkaar vergeleken. Stromingsberekeningen zijn uitgevoerd voor een gebied bestaande uit een bocht in de Dommel. De resultaten zijn vergeleken met metingen en met gepubliceerde uitkomsten van de modellen CCHED2, RMA-2 en FESWMS-2DH die eerder met elkaar zijn vergeleken in ""Application of Three Two-Dimensional Depth-Averaged Models to Flow in River Bends"", Khan & Koshino (2004). Het blijkt dat SIMONA goed met deze pakketten kan concurreren en op sommige punten zelfs betere resultaten behaalt. Er dient opgemerkt te worden dat mogelijk nog betere resultaten behaald kunnen worden door te zoeken naar betere modelparameters.","simona; modellering; stroming; orthogonaliteit; roostergeneratie","nl","bachelor thesis","TU Delft, Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science, Hydraulic Engineering","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","","","","",""

(mentor); University of Mons-Hainaut (contributor)","2008","As more people and organizations use computers, the demands on computer systems have changed. Therefore, with increasing the number of participants, the scalability has become an important issue for managing resource allocation. A centralized system relies on one computer node that processes the whole application. In such systems, a small number of nodes provide the resources that can only serve a limited number of clients. On one hand, if the centralized system becomes large enough, load balancing will create too much overhead. On the other hand, limitation on the network bandwidth increases the network bottleneck which affects the system performance. Decenralizing control, distributing processing loads and network bandwidth among all participating nodes will reduce the overhead in very large systems. In this light, Peer-To-Peer(P2P) systems offer an alternative solution to old server-based approach. Generally, a P2P system must have three essential properties. First, the system needs to be scalable. That is, it does not rely on single points of failures and bottlenecks. Second, the P2P system needs to be self-organized when peers arbitrarily join and leave the system. Third, the system needs to be fault-tolerant. In other words, the system must be robust when subjected to faults. In this thesis, we propose a dynamic decentralized P2P resource allocation method having as many resource allocators as required given the number of nodes, tasks and resources. In spite of the capability of the proposed resource allocation scheme for implementing on any structured overlay system, we implemented our application on Pastry as the underlying structured overlay system. We investigated the matchmaking process in the fully populated system when all resource allocators are active as well as the non-fully populated system when only some resource allocators perform resource allocation process. As we wanted to have a self-organized system in terms of resource allocators, we defined a mechanism that dynamically segment/desegment the ad hoc grid by promoting/demoting resource allocator(s) according to the workload of the existing resource allocator(s). This mechanism enables the ad hoc grid to adapt itself to the changing environment from a centralized to a decentralized form and back to the centralized form.","decentralized resource allocation","en","master thesis","TU Delft, Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science, Computer Engineering","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","","","","",""

(mentor)","2008","Knowledge of temperature distributions on streams and lakes is considered to be a valuable source of information for a wide range of disciplines such as ecologists, hydrologists and geochemists, as it can provide insights into the dynamics of these water bodies (Westhoff, 2006). Modeling of surface water temperature on the other hand is a complex process requiring coupling of spatial and hydrological data (Boyd, Kasper, 2003). At local scales, all influences of the landscape to the water temperature are considered important, even those which are too difficult to quantify. High resolution terrain data can compensate landscape influences by providing insight in the thermal effects of direct solar radiation (by shadow modeling) and longwave radiation (by modeling of ‘Sky View Coefficient’, SVC). Usually, the demand on high resolution terrain data is translated into increased costs during acquisition. As a result, scientists interested in temperature distribution along streams are forced to make a compromise between costs and more detailed temperature modeling. Photogrammetry employed from an aerostat platform is proposed as an inexpensive technique, able at providing terrain data of centimeter level accuracy and resolution. The applicability of the proposed method was tested on a first order stream located in Maisbich subcatchment in central Luxembourg, where temperature modeling experiments are taking place. A 10 x 10 cm digital elevation model (DEM) was extracted using photogrammetric principles for the upstream and downstream part of the subcatchment. The accuracy of the derived DEM was assessed using ground truth points measured by a total station and points collected using the floating mark principle. The resulted height root mean squared error was found 7cm for the upstream and 6.44 cm for the downstream part having the ground truth points as reference, and 8.34 cm and 23.14 cm having the floating mark points as reference. The DEM served as a basis for information extraction relevant to the temperature distribution model. The influence of shadow in the stream temperature was modeled using hillshade and viewshed algorithms. The SVC was modeled by using upward looking viewshed algorithms. The resulted data were imported in the temperature model. An improvement of 0.0727°C was observed when compared to the temperature output using data from a coarser DEM (5 x 5 meters).","Photogrammetry; DEM; Temperature Distribution","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","Optical and Laser Remote Sensing","","","",""

The aim off this report is to give better insight in the problem and present a solution. Research has been done to investigate the migration speed of the dune and the erosion rate of the beach. This is done by a photo analysis. Aerial photographs from several years and a Geographical Information System are used for this purpose. The average migration speed since 1938 of Moçambique Dune is a little more than three meters per year. In the southern part of Ingleses, the beach erodes one to two meters per year since 1960. The zero-solution is also a part of this research. Using the migration speed of the dune, the damage is quantified in case no measures are taken. Also the damage at the coast is quantified with the use of the erosion rates. Especially the damage at the coast will be significant. This zero-solution is a reference situation for the solution presented in this report and gives insight in the scale of the problems. A maximum loss of 1,5 million euro’s per year is expected in case no actions are taken. The solution presented in this report is a beach nourishment. For the nourishment, sand will be used from Moçambique Dune. This way, two problems are solved at the same time. For the design fill a beach width of 38 meter will be constructed. Also an advanced fill is calculated for a design lifetime of 10 years. The design fill is calculated with the erosion rates calculated with the photo analysis. The fill sand from the dune is coarser then the sand from the native beach. For this reason the beach will be steeper after the nourishment. In the report the construction method for the nourishment is also considered. Two construction methods are elaborated, the use of trucks and the use of pumps and pipelines. For both methods an estimation is made for the construction time and the construction costs. Both construction methods are compared in a Multi Criteria Analysis (MCA). In this comparison the pipelines turned out to be the better method. However, this method is more expensive. The zero-solution and the nourishment are also compared in a MCA. In this comparison the nourishment turned out to be the better solution. The nourishment is also the cheaper solution. Another aim of this project is the improvement of the numerical model made in 2007. Some scenarios are modelled in this research. The first scenario is the situation from 1938 when the sand from Moçambique Dune was an input of the system. Other scenarios are investigated to analyze the bypass at the northern headland. Finally, the scenario with the designed nourishment is modelled. The numerical model appeared to still be extremely sensitive to several parameters that still are not well-known like the wave characteristics and sediment bypass. Further extensive research to these parameters is necessary in order to obtain a reliable model. During this research a lot of additional data about the coastal system around Ingleses is collected and analyzed. Assumptions are verified and a better insight in several important parameters is given. It is concluded that a nourishment is a suitable and feasible solution for the erosion problems. The sand from the Moçambique Dune can be used for this nourishment which is a suitable solution for the encroachment problems as well.","Brazil; Santa Catarina; coastal morphology; Artificial beach nourishment","en","student report","TU Delft, Section Hydraulic Engineering","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","","",""

(mentor)","2008","Deep‐marine turbidity systems are highly important for hydrocarbon exploration, and understanding the influence of syn‐sedimentary faulting on submarine deposition is of great relevance to improve predictive depositional models in a fault‐constrained setting. Particular the influence of relay ramps on turbidite deposition in deep marine settings is of great relevance as they may act as pathway for sedimentary flows. A PhD project is carried out that aims on developing quantitative predictive fan models in an extensional fault‐constrained setting. Different sandbox experiments with a range of fault geometries where preformed for this purpose. The goal of this Bsc‐Project was to make a 3D Model of the 20 degree oblique sandbox experiment with syn‐rift sand infill. A 3D Model was created using the software program 3D Move™. Cross sections digitized in 2D Move™ and topview pictures of the sandbox experiment were used for the creation of the 3D Model. After creation of the horizons and different faults in the 3D model, the syn‐rift infill was build into the model. The created 3D model is still of moderate quality, but 2D and 3D Move™ offer good tools for improving the model. Thickness measurements of the infill layers were preformed. These measurements can be exported to a different software program for the creation of thickness maps. Building the 3D Model with 3D Move™, was a time consuming process. The methods for the creation of the 3D Model can be used for the creation of other 3D models of the sandbox experiments with other fault geometries.","","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Department of Applied Earth Sciences","","Applied Geology","",""
