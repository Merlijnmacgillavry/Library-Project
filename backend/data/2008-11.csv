(mentor)","2008","The exhibition of intelligent or challenging behavior by artificially controlled characters (AI) in computer games strongly depends on their navigational performance, often referred to as pathfinding. While recent games solve increasingly complex and specific navigation problems, the documented approaches to navigation remain primitive and isolated within the gaming software realm. We propose a semantic approach to navigation that allows AI to extract and incorporate a wide variety of navigation information into the planning of character behavior, including raw geometry, strategic objects, and abilities for locomotion. We design and implement a navigation system for Unreal Engine 3 that requires little designer intervention, has a rich interface for AI programmers, and can be extended with other types of semantic information. This subsystem proves to outperform the original navigation functionality by delivering more natural paths, fewer world annotation, and dynamic re-planning.","navigation","en","master thesis","TU Delft, Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science, Media and Knowledge Engineering","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","","","","",""

Since wind power is the technology with the most promising for large-scale implementation, it becomes important to understand what wind power brings to system operation. Wind is by nature variable and not 100% predictable, which adds new challenges to transmission systems operators (TSOs). If wind speeds are low, available wind power is also low and if wind speeds are high, available wind power may be high, as long as speeds do not exceed the turbine cut-out-speed. Any of these situations may happen, uncorrelated with load demand. Consequently, excess wind energy may at times need to be wasted, while at other times, reserve and regulation power available from conventional generation sources may need to be activated in order to make up for the shortage in wind energy. In addition, wind power may result in overloading of transmission lines. To study this, wind power variability and forecast errors are quantified, followed by a linear optimization technique appropriate to solve the economic dispatch problem for conventional generation sources, subject to transmission constraints. The developed optimization model can be used to answer such questions as wether technical limitations exist for the amount of wind power installed in a power system and whether new expansions must be done in order to solve transmission bottlenecks.","Wind Energy; Operating Costs & Security; Electrical Power Systems","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Electrical Power Systems","","","",""

Providing video on demand over decentralized peer-to-peer systems is an active research field. The variable bit-rate environment that characterizes peer-to-peer networks causes significant difficulties to ensure quality of service and playback continuity for video on demand applications. This thesis addresses the challenge of serving high quality video on demand by designing and implementing a multi bit-rate video on demand architecture for peer-to-peer networks. We propose a switching scheme, an encoding methodology and a novel algorithm for multiple bit-rate video streaming over peer-to-peer networks. Identical video content is encoded into three different sets of streams with different average bit-rates. The novel multi bit-rate algorithm will switch dynamically between the three sets of streams depending on the available bandwidth.

(mentor); Leus, G. (mentor); Pandharipande, A. (mentor)","2008","It has been widely recognized that utilization of radio spectrum by licensed wireless systems, e.g., TV broadcasting, aeronautical telemetry, is quite low. In particular, at any given time and spatial region, there are frequency bands where there is no signal occupancy. There has been recent interest in improving spectrum utilization by permitting secondary usage using cognitive radios. Cognitive radios use spectrum sensing to determine frequency bands that are vacant of licensed signal transmissions and transmit on such portions to meet regulatory constraints of avoiding harmful interference to licensed systems. Future cognitive radios will be capable of scanning a wide band of frequencies, in the order of a few GHz, and employ adaptive waveforms for transmission depending on the estimated spectrum of licensed systems. In this thesis, we address the problem of estimating the spectrum of the wide-band signal received at the cognitive radio sensing receiver using compressive sampling coupled with a multiband spectrum detector to determine the spectrum occupancy of the licensed system. Since individual cognitive radios might not be able to reliably detect weak primary signals due to channel fading/shadowing, we also propose a distributed compressive scheme based on joint recovery of the license occupancy for application scenarios involving geographically distributed radios. In such a distributed approach, the spectrum occupancy is determined by the joint work of cognitive radios (exploiting spatial diversity), as opposed to being determined individually by each cognitive radio.","cognitive radio; spectrum sensing; compressive sampling","en","master thesis","TU Delft, Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science, Telecommunications","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","","","","",""

(mentor)","2008","The wake behind a simplified model of a generic aircraft (the SWIM model) is measured in the Low Speed Low turbulence wind tunnel (LSL) at Delft University of Technology. Two measurement techniques have been used in order to qualitatively and quantitatively measure the wake, i.e. stereoscopic particle image velocimetry (Stereo PIV) and a 5 hole probe (5HP). Furthermore balance measurements have been carried out over a range of configurations for later comparison purposes. The goal of the wake measurements is to give a comparison between the two measurement techniques. The 5HP measurements are processed using a windows based program called Pressure Field Visualisation. This program calculates vector fields from the input pressure data and has several exporting options. The Stereo PIV measurements are correlated using DaVis 7.3 using a window size of 16 x 16 pixels with 50% overlap. The results showed that the Stereo PIV measurements contained more noise than the 5HP measurements. Furthermore, the measured vorticity in and near the vortex centers were lower for the Stereo PIV technique. This is caused by the lower resolution of the Stereo PIV arrangement used in the current research. The jet outflow has been measured with the 5HP and is symmetrical. The data is analysed using Matlab routines, where a program is written to analyse and edit the flow field. The analysis is done by calculating and removing the downwash and removing the influence of each vortex on the other vortex by making a tangential velocity fit. Then a second tangential velocity fit of the clean vortex is created. For the cases where the yaw angle is zero the measurement techniques give comparable tangential velocity fits. The 5HP has a larger damping in the pressure acquisition system creating a wider scatter in the tangential velocity data from the Stereo PIV technique. When the angle of attack is increased for both vortices the core radius stays equal but the maxi- mum tangential velocity increases yielding a higher circulation. By activating a jet the vortices get a larger core radius while a decrease in maximum tangential velocity is found. The spacing used in the wake survey analysis (using WAKE) is of importance for obtaining good results. Different spatial resolutions have been analysed which resulted in a maximum of 3 to 4 mm spacing after which the results diverge. The drag results are mostly influenced by the change in induced drag when the spatial resolution decreases. This indicates that the Stereo PIV data grid should give comparable results to the 5HP out of the wake analysis. The 5HP measurements show good agreement with the balance measurements. The lift coefficient is close to the lift coefficient measured with the balance (with a maximum difference of 5%) while the drag coefficient is slightly lower (around 80% from the balance measurements) due to the drag of the support strut out- side the measured wake. However the calculated lift in the Stereo PIV measurements are lower then those from the 5HP measurements. The spatial resolution of the Stereo PIV arrangement is the cause of this. After increasing the vorticity near the vortices and removing the vorticity outside the wake, the local lift distribution was equal to that of the 5HP. Comparisons with previous studies show that there is an agreement with test data from both the DNW as well as the towing tank. The data obtained by the NLR gives a com- parable lift distribution to the distribution found in this thesis. Their measurements are performed further behind the model (x=b = 1:25). The calculated local lift distribution show that the vortices have moved slightly around each other. The tangential velocity data from the towing tank also show similarities to those in the current research. Both the shape and core radius of the vortices are alike.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","","","","",""

(mentor); University of Sydney (contributor)","2008","The rise of sea level (18 to 91 cm in South Australia by the end of the 21st century) will result in beach erosion and, hence, poses a significant risk to the beaches of southeast Australia. This risk can be mitigated by means of beach nourishment. The costs of applying beach nourishment to the coast of southeast Australia in the 21st century have been estimated in the present study. The uncertainty associated with sea level rise and its impact on the coast has been managed by adopting a probabilistic approach. The expected offshore sand losses due to sea level rise have been estimated with the raising the profile method, a derivative of the Bruun Rule, and are between 2.8 and 6.2 billion m3, where the actual value depends on the selected risk level (between 1 and 50%). The offshore sand resources in southeast Australia contain enough good quality sand to replenish these sand losses. Because the economic viability of applying beach nourishment depends strongly on the degree of beach development, it has been assumed that only the presently developed beaches (20% of the coastline), in due time, the future developed beaches (up to 60%) will be nourished. The beach nourishment costs have been estimated by multiplying the required amounts of sand with the sand costs, which are the lowest in case of using offshore sand resources. In that case, the costs of nourishing the presently developed beaches are between 2.6 and 6.3 billion Australian dollars and the costs of nourishing both the presently and the future developed beaches are between 7.3 and 17.4 billion Australian dollars. However, offshore sand extraction is currently prohibited in the state New South Wales and in case the beaches are nourished with onshore sand, the costs will be about seven times higher. The results of the present study can be used to develop an economically optimum beach nourishment programme.","beach nourishment; Southeast Australia; sea level rise; Bruun rule; probabilistic approach","en","master thesis","TU Delft, Civil Engineering and Geosciences, Hydraulic Engineering","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","","","","",""

(mentor); Geleynse, N. (mentor); Jacobse, J.J. (mentor); De Ronde, J.G. (mentor)","2008","For local protection of coastal stretches where buildings are situated in or form part of the coastal defense line the deep water reef concept has been developed. Two reef concepts were designed; a shore-parallel breakwater (of 3 km length) and a segmented breakwater (three blinds of 1 km length), both located in 10 m water depth at 1.5 km off the coast of Scheveningen. In the present research the hydrodynamics and long term morphodynamics of the two deep water reefs are analyzed with the physics-based numerical model Delft3D. The two reef concepts are modeled in 2DH mode with the Parallel Online morphological approach. The hydrodynamic processes at submerged breakwaters are different from those operating at emerged breakwaters. Wave transmission by the submerged breakwater crest creates two additional effects; 1) a water level set-up with a discharge over the reef and 2) reduced wave action at the landward area of the reef. The water level set-up drives two large-scale circulation cells off the reef tips, with velocities up to 1 m/s. In the surf zone the longshore currents are directed towards the shadow zone, where the second effect creates a sheltered area. The magnitude of these effects is for the parallel reef concept amongst other parameters dependent on the wave height and wave transmission, whereas for the blinds reef concept this is also dependent on the wave direction due to the orientation of the blinds. The longshore varying currents and reduced waves in the surf zone cause the coastline to development into a salient form. At the lee of the reef accretion occurs, whereas at the southward and northward sides of the sheltered area erosion occurs. The morphological development is similar for the two reef concepts and of the same order of magnitude. The blinds reef is the preferred alternative for construction, as less severe erosion is modeled to occur. Equilibrium will likely be attained in 15 to 25 years after construction.","reef; hydrodynamics; morphodynamics; delft3d; wave transmission","en","master thesis","TU Delft, Civil Engineering and Geosciences, Hydraulic Engineering","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","","","","",""

The materials generally have a high strength to weight ratio, allowing lightweight structures. In buildings little use is made of FRP, in this study the possibility to use the material to create lightweight floors is explored. The goal of the study is the design of a long span floor (25 m) with the use of FRP. The total thickness should be limited to 1.0 m, as a result a plenum is not possible. The installations need to be integrated in the structural height of the floor. The floors should be safe and comfortable for its users. The first part of the study is a design part. The shape of the floor plate and the distribution system for the ventilation and lighting are adapted to each other. To be able to build fast and be able to reuse the floor plates simple connections are made which depend on shape and bolts. A radiating ceiling is developed with a water-filled layer. This ceiling can be used for heating and cooling, also during fire, as a structural layer and for improvement of acoustics. In the second part of the study the safety of the floor during a fire is determined and the comfort of the floor regarding sound insulation and vibrations caused by walking is determined. For a sufficient long fire safety level, provisions are needed. A layer of mineral wool, also improving the room acoustics, can insulate the ceiling leading to a fire safety of at least 40 minutes. The alternative is the use of the water-filled ceiling, with this solution the fire safety is close to infinite. The sound insulation of the floor is determined with an adaptation of the mass-law, taking sound insulation reducing effects into account. The resulting sound insulation is sufficient for most uses, but not for floors separating residences. Due to their low weight the floors will vibrate well due to footfall. With the use of the SBR publication ‘Trillingen van vloeren door lopen’ and FEM analysis the performance of the floor is determined. The result was insufficient, the floor plates need a higher stiffness, increasing material use and as a result cost. Conclusions: Long span FRP floors can be made. The floors can be safe and comfortable with a high level of integration of the installations. The floors can be disassembled and reused. A drawback is the high costs, these are caused by the expensive materials used. A shorter span (7.2 m) floor will be less expensive, but compared with conventional floors the cost are still a factor three too high to be competitive.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Design and Construction","","","",""

Vanaf 1951 heeft het gebouw andere functies gehuisvest, waarvan de laatste in 2008 het gebouw zal verlaten. De trapsgewijze percelenstructuur binnen het gehele bouwblok is een uitdrukking van het vroegere gebruik als wijnpercelen. Tegenwoordig wonen er in de omgeving van de wijk Belleville naast arbeiders ook steeds meer (Chinese) immigranten en jonge creatievelingen. A2. Mijn afstudeerproject beslaat het herontwerp van de fabriek tot een Multi-cultureel Filmhuis, ontmoetingspunt en lokale Televisiestudio. De ‘deftige’ Art Nouveau gevel en –elementen, de ‘stoere’ Betonconstructies en industriële Staalconstructies blijven hierbij als belangrijke originele waarden behouden. Voor een betere uitdrukking van de architectuur van de Staalconstructies worden op één perceel enkele vervallen appartementen langs de straat gesloopt. Hierbij ontstaat een accent in de zeer dichte stedenbouwkundige structuur, wat de publieke functie van het gebouw versterkt en tot een nieuwe entree uitnodigd. A3. Het belangrijkste concept in mijn ontwerp is de nieuwe, architectonische verbinding tussen de 4 historische percelen waar het Fabrieksensemble zich in de loop der jaren tot heeft uitgebreid. Deze ‘Route’ bestaat voor een groot deel uit rechtlijnige looppaden, luie trappen en trappenhuizen. Via de centrale ‘ontmoetingspleinen’, vides, lichthoven en enkele immense atria is ze verankerd met de bestaande gebouwstructuur. De “Route” zorgt er ook voor dat de 3 nieuwe verschillende functies naast, en vooral boven elkaar kunnen functioneren. A4. In het ontwerp is ook veel aandacht voor de verbinding tussen het Begane Grond niveau en de lagergelegen ‘Tuinkamers’ binnenin het bouwblok, zodat deze toegankelijker worden voor publiek. Met de nieuwe, architectonische ingrepen zijn er 3 ruimere, duidelijker afgebakende groene verblijfsruimtes gecreeërd. A5. Net als de originele architecturen, kenmerkt mijn nieuwe, toegevoegde architectuur zich door haar constructieve ‘duidelijkheid’ en transparantie. Dit karakter uit zich nu via de moderne materialen staal, glas, zink en rubber. De nieuwe, gebogen glasgevel naast het entreegebied is Bouwtechnisch nader uitgewerkt. Naast ‘eyecatcher’ in het straatbeeld, moest deze ook zo transparant mogelijk worden, om de achtergelegen oude Staalconstructies als het ware ‘tentoon te stellen’. Naast een fijnzinnige vormgeving en detaillering heb ik er daarom voor gekozen de vertikale dragers van de glasgevelpanelen uit te voeren als voorgespannen glazen liggers.","herontwerp; r-mit; meccano; parijs; belleville; filmhuis; televisiestudio; tuinkamers; percelen; route; bouwblok; gebogen glasgevel; fabriek; 1921","nl","master thesis","","","","","","","","2009-06-13","Architecture","RMIT","","","",""

An application of VR is Virtual Reality Exposure Therapy (VRET) in which a phobia patient is exposed to a virtual environment containing the feared stimulus instead of being taken into a real environment or having to imagine the stimulus. This research aims to examine if the simulated social situation in the prototype virtual environment, especially developed for this purpose, is able to provoke the same behavioral response as the real life situation. If this is the case, it would be a step towards implementation of VRET in social phobia treatment. Two cases were examined in the prototype virtual environment to assess whether it was able to recreated social behavior of people. First, we examined if participant who enter a crowded room in the virtual environment prefer to take a seat in a chair that is close to them. Secondly, we investigated if participants in the virtual environment have the tendency to physically distance themselves from strangers when choosing a seat in a room full of strangers. We covered the prototype design of a social situation in a virtual world, the implementation of the prototype, the applied software and techniques and the results of a pilot experiment with the virtual world. We concluded, based on the two cases we examined during our experiments, that a social situation can be recreated in a virtual world.","virtual reality; phobia; treatment; virtual environment","en","master thesis","TU Delft, Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science, Media and Knowledge Engineering","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","","","","",""

The approach is refined by the use of camera proximity weights and an outlier removal method. The rendering system can handle occlusions and can cope with a broad range of different sceneries.

(mentor); Coenders, J.L. (mentor); De Vries, P.A. (mentor); Hendriks, M.A.N. (mentor); Houtman, R. (mentor); Luchsinger, R.H. (mentor)","2008","Tensairity is a new lightweight structural concept which can be classified as a pneumatic structure. By adding a compression element and cables to an inflated tube a structural system is obtained in which the strut and cables carry the applied load and the air tube transfers forces between both and stabilises the compression element against buckling. The structure combines the favourable features of pneumatics (light, deployable, compact storage and transport volume) with good structural properties and moderate air pressures. Thus, Tensairity is interesting for a wide range of applications, from roof structures to (temporary) bridges and tent structures. Next to beams the Tensairity concept can also be applied to columns and arches. Tensairity research currently focuses on structural improvements which can contribute to the applicability of the concept. One of these improvements is the use of a stiffening membrane strip inside the pneumatic tube. This ‘web’ is ascribed a positive effect on the stabilisation of the compression element. This thesis investigates the stabilising effect of the inflated tube on the compression element in Tensairity, and particularly the effect of the web on this behaviour. The approach is essentially experimental. First the concept of pressure induced stability and the web effect are investigated analytically and experimentally by means of small models. The models appear to display higher buckling loads for increasing pressures, even approaching the theoretical yield load of the compression element. Furthermore, the web improves the buckling load with a factor 2 in practice. Next, full-scale experiments are performed on two 5 m long Tensairity columns, both consisting of three aluminium struts supported and stabilised by an inflated membrane hull: one without and one with internal webs. For different hull pressures the columns are subjected to an axial compressive load. The responses are analysed and compared, also with FE predictions from ANSYS. For both columns the axial stiffness and the buckling load appear to improve for higher pressures in practice, emphasising the stabilising effect of overpressure. The maximum registered buckling load is over 25 kN, which is a promising result. The column with webs performs better than the one without webs: the increase in stiffness and capacity is around 35 % for an average pressure of 150 mbar. In general this improvement is lower than expected from the small models and the FE results, and not sufficient to counteract the drawbacks of the web model regarding applications, like an increased weight and more complicated fabrication. Thus, the application of a web is at this point not an effective contribution to the functioning of a Tensairity column. Yet, in comparison with a conventional truss column of similar dimensions both Tensairity columns display a sound structural behaviour, and they offer clear advantages in terms of deployability and architecture. A Tensairity column would therefore be especially interesting for temporary applications, e.g. acting as a pole in a tent structure.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Design and Construction","","","",""

One of the eye-catchers of Dubailand will be the Great Dubai Wheel, a multifunctional Ferris wheel with a diameter of 185 meters. In contrast with the existing Ferris Wheels this wheel does not have any spokes. Furthermore, being supported by the entrance building, the wheel will be used not only as an observation wheel, but also as a slowly rotating hotel. Research: Removing the spokes will have great influence on the structural behavior. To understand the structural behavior of this centre less Ferris wheel the structure and loads of the current design, were modeled and analyzed using the finite element program SCIA ESA PT. Using this model the strength, stiffness and stability of the basic design were analyzed. The feasibility was checked using the Dutch NEN code. Conclusion: By leaving out the spokes the structural behavior of the wheel will change considerably. Where the stiffness and the global stability of the structure are sufficient, the strength of the current structure will be insufficient. The distribution of the forces shows a peak above the highest support. The peak, which is caused by the restriction of the deformation by the support construction, will have a negative influence on the static and the fatigue strength of the wheel. To create a feasible structure the peak should be reduced by adjusting the design of the Wheel, the support structure, or both.","","nl","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Design and Construction","","","",""

Piçarras is one of the touristic beaches of Santa Catarina state in Brazil. Piçarras beach is a headland bay beach. In the bay irregular features like an island, rocky outcrops and shoals are present influencing wave propagation. In the south Piçarras is bounded by Piçarras river. The river mouth has been fixated in 1970, after which erosion started. The part just a few hundred meters north of the river jetty has the most severe erosion. The erosion gradually decreases towards the north, where even some accretion has been measured. When the situation became critical a nourishment was executed in 1999, which has disappeared totally on some places. The decrease in beach width causes a devaluation of the houses and a decrease in tourism which consequently leads to a decrease of employment. It is therefore necessary to investigate the causes and the amount of the erosion and to generate measures to counteract the negative impact of the erosion. Prosul, a Brazilian engineering company, has designed a nourishment of which execution started in July 2008. The main goal of this study is investigate erosion at Piçarras beach and to design a nourishment to counteract the effects of the current erosion. A model has been built to represent the situation at Piçarras beach. With the model the evolution of the nourishment and the evolution of the existing plan of Prosul could be evaluated. The bathymetry has been composed of recent profile measurements and old nautical maps. They have all been related to the reference level of IBGE. To investigate the erosion at Piçarras beach the wave climate has been schematised. The available wave data was given for four direction (NE, E, SE, S) in the form of wave heights and periods. To be able to compare what the results of the incoming wave energy from these four directions were on the erosion and accretion on the beach, a schematisation has been made. A representative average wave per direction has been determined, that supplied the same energy input from that direction as did all the different waves from that direction. Headland bay beaches are historically formed in such a way that the incoming waves and thereby the wave energy, arrive perpendicular at the beach, thus absorbing the incoming wave energy in the most efficient way. This theory formed the basis of this schematisation. The mean tidal variation is 0.6m, at spring tide this is 0.9m. Storm surges lead to a set-up in water level of approximately 1.0m. Currents and wind are not taken into account. The sediment present at the beach has a D50 of 0.285mm. The sand used in the nourishment of 1999 was coarser than the native sand, which had a D50 of 0.260mm. Erosion processes can take the sand either in cross-shore direction or in longshore direction. Without looking at the underlying process, just to get a realistic idea of the erosion and accretion patterns, the amount of eroded sediment has been calculated with shoreline changes and deduced erosion rates [2]. The erosion of the past nine years is calculated to be 395,000 m3. To find out where the sediment is transported to at Piçarras beach a model has been build. First the nearshore wave conditions have been modelled with Delft3D (D3D) for the four wave scenarios. These conditions serve as input for Unibest (UB). This program is applied to model the shoreline changes.","Brazil; headland; coastal morphology; artificial beach nourishment","en","student report","TU Delft, Section Hydraulic Engineering","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","","",""

(mentor)","2008","Flow separation on an airfoil can pose serious consequences. Almost always a decrease in lift and an increase in drag can be seen. To counteract ow separation, many separation control devices have been investigated. The control devices can be subdivided into passive and active methods. The difference is that passive methods do not add energy to the ow whereas active methods do. The passive device mostly applied and investigated is the VG. A relatively new active ow control method is periodic surface excitation. A periodically moving surface influences the ow such that separation is postponed. However the question is how effective periodic surface excitation is with respect to other methods. Furthermore it is still unclear how the postponement of separation is established. The aim of this report is to compare the effectiveness of periodic surface ex- citation with the effectiveness of Vortex Generators. Furthermore in this report an explanation is given why periodic surface excitation can produce postponement of separation. The comparison is based on experimental research. The model used in the experiment is a ramp. On the back side separation was provoked. In the given setup separation was triggered at the top of this ramp. The Vortex Generator and the actuator that provided surface excitation were placed in front of the separation point. By testing different configurations, the reduction of the separation area was determined. The reduction was measured by means of pressure, tuft and PIV measurements. An explanation why periodic surface excitation could reduce the separation area was investigated by PIV measurements.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","","","","",""

(mentor); Verhagen, H.J. (mentor)","2008","Coastal erosion is a serious problem in several coastal areas in Vietnam. One of these areas is the district of Hai Hau, located in Nam Dinh province. This district suffers from severe coastal erosion, the coastline has been retreating for more than 100 years. Efforts have been made to stop this erosion which resulted in the construction of strong seadikes along almost the Hai Hau coastline. These seawalls are placed relatively close to the waterline. Therefore, during extreme conditions the waterlevels in front of the dike become high. Field observations have shows that during these extreme conditions scour holes are formed in front of these dikes. Since little is know about the influence of the geometrical dike properties on the scour development wave flume test have been carried out with a movable bed to gain more insight in this problem. These tests have been carried out in the Holland wave flume of the Hanoi Water Resources University. In addition the tests were simulated in the computational model DUROSTA. This model is developed to determine dune erosion under storm conditions. The model is extended so that it can include hard structures such as seadikes. The geometrical dike properties that are tested are: Dikeslopes. - Initial slopes in the seabed near the dikes. - Cylinders placed at the toe of the dikes. - Crownwalls placed on top of the dikes. The most important results following from this series of test are the influence of the reflection coefficient of the scour behavior. In the wave flume tests the two properties that are of main positive influence on the reflection coefficient are: Increasing dike slope. - Increasing wave period. - Increasing crownwall height. - An increasing reflection coefficient does not give larger scour depths as is to be expected from known literature about scour near seawalls. The area and length of erosion however does become larger. The influence of crownwalls on the reflections coefficient is governing over the influence of increasing wave period on the reflection coefficient. An other test properties that is of influence for a larger area of erosion is the initial sloping seabed. The modeling of the wave flume tests with DUROSTA give the following results: The performance of DUROSTA after 2 hours is quite accurate with the measured field experiments, DUROSTA underestimates the scour depth with an average of 4%. The average underestimation of the scour depth in DUROSTA after 4 hours of testing is 19%. In DUROSTA the influence of the wave period on the scour development is governing over the influence of increasing crownwall height.","movable bed; seadikes; Vietnam; durosta; physical model","en","master thesis","TU Delft, Civil Engineering and Geosciences, Hydraulic Engineering","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","","","","",""
