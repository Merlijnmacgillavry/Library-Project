(mentor)","2005","The use of more flexible structures in aircraft offers considerable potential for more efficient aircraft, but increased exibility makes aircraft structures more susceptible to destructive interactions with the air ow around them. Numerical simulations are necessary to predict the behavior of these interactions so that aircraft designers can avoid destructive fluid-structure interactions (FSI). One possible way to simulate FSI is by coupling existing Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) and Computational Structural Mechanics (CSM) solvers. Two improved algorithms were developed to couple existing CFD and CSM solvers using a coarse grid correction and high-order Additive Runge-Kutta (ARK) time integration schemes. The new algorithms reduce the partitioning error by computing accurate predictions for the coupling terms on coarse grids. Both coarse grid corrections and ARK schemes have previously been used in CFD and CSM, but their combined application to FSI simulation is new. It was demonstrated for an FSI test problem that the new algorithms may reduce the amount of work to obtain levels of accuracy acceptable for engineering by an order of magnitude. Future work will include extending the newly developed algorithms to nonlinear problems and implementing them in new FSI solvers.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","","","","",""

The methodology is generic in the sense it can be used on any network topology, with any number of VMS's, for different scenario's (e.g. recurrent congestion or accidents), based on a flexible user defined objective function and will work as long as feasible route alternatives exist. i The methodology uses a new and for this purpose developed macroscopic model called DSMART (dynamic, 1^^ order, macroscopic, single user class, probit route choice, split vectors) and a customized parallel implemented evolutionary algorithm (EA). By using simulation data from the DSMART model in combination with customized mutation operators in the EA, VMS settings are generated in a smart way to increase convergence speed. A prototype ofthe methodology has been developed in Matlab and applied in a case study to the city of Rotterdam in the Netherlands by using a network representation (approx. 500 links) of the motorway with six different VMS's and the connected urban network. The case study illustrated the generic nature by successfully optimizing all three different scenarios ranging from the: everyday recurrent morning congestion, a simulated accident and an extreme event (football final match) by generating a dynamic set of VMS settings for all six instances. As a measure for optimization, the objective function was utilized to express tlie generalized gross travei time \N[)\ch led to a system optimal assignment. To implement the methodology, a rolling horizon control framework is suggested including a crude scenario manager This suggested type of scenario management could be able to reduce the usually astronomical high number of scenarios needed in other systems, to a workable amount. Based upon expected efficiency increase when professionally implemented in the suggested rolling horizon implementation, it is expected that optimal controlled VMS settings could be calculated online for the case study network.","DSMART; DTA Model; evolutionary algorithm; prescriptive; route guidance; road side; optimal control; rolling horizon; scenario management; generic","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Transport & Planning","","","",""

(mentor)","2005","The growing need for space to offer the opportunities for growth and renewal of port related activities for the port of Rotterdam has lead to the project mainport development Rotterdam. Within the framework of this project, a land reclamation has been foreseen, Maasvlakte 2. For this land reclamation two different types of sea defences will be applied, on the northern boundary a hard flood defence and on the western boundary a soft flood defence. Between these two types of flood defences a transitional construction must be placed. In the design of Maasvlakte 2, the transition between the hard and the soft flood defence has not yet been sufficiently defined. Furthermore, the transition construction of Maasvlakte 2 may offer a unique opportunity to apply an artificial surf reef. In this thesis research a number of alternatives for the construction of a combination between the transition construction and an artificial surf reef will be presented, where the surfing conditions have been analysed for each of the alternatives. For the design of the construction hydraulic boundary conditions are required at different locations. With the aid of the model SWAN the hydraulic boundary conditions, as they are determined at several locations in the North Sea are translated to near shore conditions. The hydraulic conditions on the North Sea have been transferred from marginal probability to condition with combined statistics with the aid of physical relations that exist between the different hydraulic parameters. To determine the optimum working point for the design the functions of the construction have been divided into three basic functions: constraining of the sand profile, blocking of the longshore transport, and creation of surfable waves. The optimum dimensions of the construction for the first two functions are defined with an economical analysis. The result of this was a relatively long dam which costs slightly less than 40,000,000. The toe depth in this case is NAP - 7.2 m and the crest height is NAP - 1.0 m. The surfing optimum was found with a reef that starts at a water depth of 2 meter. The optimum dimensions for the surf reef were found to be to rather different for the toe depth and the crest height of the dam with respect to the morphological functions. For a better fulfilment of the functions it is advisable to split the functions into two different constructions. The design that provides the best fulfilment of the functions is the alternative with a separate reef (see figure). The stability calculations show that constructing the Westdam similar to the Noorderdam is a reasonable option. The calculations of the sand containers that will be used for the construction of the surf reef show that the elements need a nominal diameter, Dn50 of 3.4 m. Due to the dynamic behaviour of the beach in the zone where the reef is placed, it is recommended to do additional research on the morphology around the reef on the beach.","","en","master thesis","TU Delft, Faculty of Civil Engineering and Geosciences, Hydraulic Engineering","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","","","","",""

In Weesperkarspel is één van de zuiveringsstappen desinfectie door middel van ozondosering. Het water dat in Weesperkarspel gezuiverd wordt, wordt gewonnen in de Bethunepolder en voorgezuiverd in Loenderveen. Hierbij wordt ozon geproduceerd uit droge lucht en wordt dan gedoseerd in een bellenkolom. Echter, door de hoge concentratie aan organisch materiaal (DOC) in het water, wordt een groot deel van de gedoseerde ozon niet gebruikt voor het beoogde doel, desinfectie, maar reageert met dit organisch materiaal. Hierbij ontstaat makkelijk afbreekbaar materiaal (AOC), dat geconsumeerd wordt door de bacteriën op de actieve koolfilters. Als dit AOC niet verwijderd wordt is het een belangrijke voedingsbron voor bacteriën in het distributienetwerk. In de zomermaanden wordt er zoveel AOC gevormd dat de actieve koolfilters te vaak verstopt raken door de biomassa en dat er dus te vaak teruggespoeld moet worden. Daarom is besloten om de ozondosering in de zomerperiode te verminderen. Echter, door deze verlaging van de ozondosis is het niet aantoonbaar dat de desinfectie op Weersperkarspel goed werkt en zal waarschijnlijk de Ct-waarde verhoogd moeten worden. In dit onderzoek is de invloed van DOC-verwijdering op de ozonisatie onderzocht. Ook is onderzocht of er een invloed is van de soort DOC die verwijderd wordt op de ozonisatie en of het mogelijk is om met een lagere ozondosering te werken wanneer de DOC-concentratie verlaagd is. Hiertoe zijn er experimenten gedaan in de proefinstallatie zonder DOC-verwijdering en met DOCverwijdering door actieve koolfiltratie en ionenwisseling. Uit het onderzoek is gebleken dat actieve koolfiltratie alle fracties van het DOC in dezelfde mate afvangt, terwijl de gebruikte ionenwisselaar vooral de humuszuren verwijderde. Dit was terug te zien in de lagere SUVA-waarden, maar ook in de DOC-karakteriseringen was dit heel duidelijk waarneembaar. In Ct, AOC- en bromaatvorming was er echter vrijwel geen verschil te zien tussen water dat was voorbehandeld met ionenwisseling of met actieve koolfiltratie. Wel was de invloed van DOC-concentratie zichtbaar op de Ct, bromaat- en AOC-vorming. Over het algemeen kon gezegd worden dat zowel Ct als bromaatvorming stijgt, naarmate er minder DOC in het water aanwezig is bij eenzelfde ozondosering. Er wordt meer AOC gevormd bij hogere ozondoseringen. Het verschil is groter bij hoge DOC-concentraties. Verder heeft een DOC-concentratie een grote invloed op de standtijd van actieve koolfilters. Bij een verlaging van de DOC-concentratie van 6 naar 4 mg/l, de wordt de standtijd van de actief koolfilters ruim 4 maal zo lang kan zijn. Dit zal nog wel met behulp van experimenten onderzocht moeten worden.","WLB; ozonisatie; AOC; DOC","nl","master thesis","Technische Universiteit Delft, Faculteit der Civiele Techniek en Geowetenschappen, Sectie Watermanagement","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","","","","",""

Therefore, five alternatives of land reclamation are designed to accommodate industrial activities and an offshore airport near the Port of Rotterdam. Three alternatives are located southwest of the Maasvlakte and two alternatives north of the approach channel of the Port of Rotterdam. Tidal elevation is simulated for each alternative with Delft3D, 2DH-mode (depth-averaged), to indicate the impact of each alternative on the tidal flow along the Dutch coast and hydrodynamics in the approach channel. Appraisal of these results indicates that the alternative of a Peninsula attached to the Maasvlakte pointing in southwest direction has the least impact on the tidal flow and is further examined to indicate the impact on the wave climate and morphology. The impact of the land reclamation on the wave climate is noticeable in the area enclosed by Scheveningen, Goeree Overflakkee and the peninsula. With normal wave conditions, the impact at the coastline of Goeree Overflakkee is < 5%. The impact of the peninsula on morphology is examined by simulation with sediment transport. The short-term simulations are done with Delft3D, sed-online (Van Rijn 2004). The long-term simulations are done with Delft3D-Ram (Rapid Assessment of Morphology, where flow and morphological calculations are decoupled). Both simulations determine significant erosion at the west side of the land reclamation (due to contraction of the tidal flow) and relatively less erosion will occur west of Schouwen Duiveland and Goeree Overflakkee. It is expected that less sedimentation will occur in the approach channel of the Port of Rotterdam. The relative longshore transport, for short- and long-term simulations, is determined at three cross-shore transects, i.e. Hook of Holland, Scheveningen and Noordwijk. Integration of the mean total longshore transport over the transect length indicates an increase in longshore direction, which could indicate erosion along this part of the coastline. The land reclamation will have an impact on the silt transport along the Dutch coast. A rough indication of influence on the silt transport is examined, leading to the following crude estimates: Siltation in the area enclosed by the peninsula and Goeree Overflakke will increase by considering tidal storage, which leads to an increase of this tidal area with a factor 2. Siltation in harbour basins of the Port of Rotterdam may decrease slightly (10 to 20%) as the water entering the system will originate from deeper water at the North Sea. The reduction of the siltation may be of the order of 1 2 [Mm3/year]. Siltation in Eastern-, Western Scheldt and Wadden Sea may change slightly. Finally, it can be determined that the large-scale land reclamation may be a good solution for the long-term spatial problems in the coastal zone when considering the aspects examined and the simplifications used in this study. Most side-effects are small or can be compensated and are only located in the direct vicinity of the land reclamation. Other side-effects contribute positively to the coastal safety of the Dutch coast. Further detailed studies should indicate the long-term and large-scale effects on sediment transport and the effects on the area between the land reclamation and Goeree Overflakkee.","","en","master thesis","TU Delft, Faculty of Civil Engineering and Geosciences, Hydraulic Engineering","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","","","","",""

(mentor)","2005","Shallow flows are three-dimensional flows with two dimensions being signifcantly larger than the third dimension. Coherent structures, also called eddies, are areas in the flow, where velocity fluctuations are correlated, with a certain rotation. Although, generally, coherent structures of the order of the waterdepth contain most of the turbulent kinetic energy, compared to coherent structures of other length-scales, coherent structures of all length-scales have a certain amount of energy. This research was particularly focussed on the amount of energy of coherent structures with length-scales larger than the water-depth, the so-called supra-depth length-scales. It turned out, that these coherent structures are of large importance with regard to the, for quasi-two-dimensional flow characteristic, upcascading to larger length-scales, which is clearly visible by a peak-shift to the low-frequency side of the energy-density spectra. Considering that large-scale coherent structures are less dissipative compared to smaller-scale coherent structures, it can be inferred that imposing perturbations has a clear effect with respect to the conservation of turbulent kinetic energy in (by definition hypothetical) two-dimensional flows. This knowledge can be used and applied in two-dimensional depth-averaged simulations (e.g. RANS, TRANS, etc.,), where the large-scale part of general spectral distributions can be mimicked by a kinematic simulation. This thus formulated and used model (2D-TRANS+ks) has been applied to a channel flow with a grid of obstacles at the inow boundary. Considering the quantities energy and enstrophy, and the energy-density spectra, the model performed reasonably well. Nevertheless, this model should be applied with care and a critical eye, as three-dimensional effects are difficult to represent in a two-dimensional model.","","en","master thesis","TU Delft, Faculty of Civil Engineering and Geosciences, Hydraulic Engineering","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","","",""

(mentor); Zitman, T.J. (mentor); Pietrzak, G.J. (mentor); de Ronde, J.G. (mentor)","2005","The North Sea is a shallow sea on the Eurasian continental shelf. This study focuses on the temporal development of the tidal range in the southern part of the North Sea. Records of annual tidal range data from gauging stations along the Dutch coast show in general an increasing trend perturbed by random fluctuations. Changes in tidal ranges are caused by natural (periodic) processes and anthropogenic effects. To examine the impact of human measures on the tidal range, the natural components are separated from the recorded tidal range. The only natural cycle significantly present in annual mean tidal range records is the nodal tide with a period of 18.6 yr and amplitudes of 0.2-2.0%. The short-term (few years) fluctuations are qualitatively similar for different stations with individual peaks occurring at the same time. This indicates that the noisy signal is caused by regional processes and not by measurement errors (as is not expected using annual mean values). The residual tidal range shows that apart from noise the tidal range remained constant form the early 19th century till circa 1955. During the period 1955-1980 a gradual increase in tidal range is observed at all stations. Although differences exist between the stations, their trends are very similar. Because the short-term and the long-term developments are similar, it is meaningful to construct an artificial average of the tidal range records from different stations. In this study the average of the Dutch stations and the average of the German stations are compared. The analysis shows that a similar gradually increasing trend is observed at the Dutch and German coast. The hypothesis that this trend is caused by coastal engineering in the River Rhine delta, is tested. A conceptual model is applied in which the North Sea is schematised to a rectangular basin. Estuaries with tidal prisms corresponding to Zeeland estuaries are included in this model. The model shows that the tidal range increases at the mouth of the estuary when it is closed. This increase decays along the Dutch coast with a typical length with an order of magnitude of 150 km. The results of the conceptual model are supported by a detailed model study incorporating the shape of the coast line and the bathymetry [LANGENDOEN, E. J. (1987) Onderzoek naar de vergroting van het tijverschil te Vlissingen. Faculteit der Civiele Techniek. Delft, TU Delft]. Both analyses suggest strong evidence that the tidal range is not significantly affected north of Den Helder after a closure of an estuary in the Zeeland delta. This implies that the observed trend at the Dutch and German coast does not have as common cause coastal engineering in the River Rhine delta. A satisfactory explanation for the trend since 1955 is not given in this report. However, our results suggest that the most likely cause is complex changes in the oceanic and the shelf sea system due to meteorological and astronomic changes. Analyses of tidal spectra based on hourly observations can give more insight into the processes involved.","","en","master thesis","TU Delft, Faculty of Civil Engineering and Geosciences, Hydraulic Engineering","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","","","","",""

(mentor); Stive, M.J.F. (mentor)","2005","The objective of this study is to test the use and applicability of the Unibest CL+ and TC models for the White Lagoon case. The White Lagoon is a small bay near Balchik, Bulgaria, that is characterised by two T-groynes and a rocky bottom nearshore. A local hotel would like the present beach to be enlarged to accommodate for more guests. In addition, due to bad circulation algae and seaweeds flourish in the tourist season. Different data are available, including results from a bathymetric survey, wind data, offshore wave data, sediment sieve curves and some preliminary research. Relevant physical processes are identified, such as wave transformation due to decreasing water depth and wave-induced currents and sediment transport. It is expected that different wave conditions cause widely varying processes. Due to limited breaker depth under normal wave conditions, there will be no longshore sediment transport offshore from the groynes, whereas under storm conditions, longshore transport is expected offshore from the groynes and cross-shore transport from the zone between the groynes to the offshore zone. Unibest CL+ is a single line coastline model that assumes an invariant bottom profile. Unibest CL+ is therefore incapable of modelling cross-shore dynamics, for which Unibest TC is used. For a number of reasons, it is not possible to model the entire area in Unibest CL+ and as a result the model area is limited to the area between the groynes, where diffracted waves are used as wave input. Unibest TC is used to model cross-shore dynamics for a profile between the groynes. Many problems have been encountered when applying the models. The most important problem is the lack of good calibration data. Furthermore it is expected that both models, which have been designed for sandy coasts, are very limited in their applicability to the rocky coast with little available sand at White Lagoon. It is recommended for the follow-up of this study that better calibration data is collected by measuring wave properties throughout the surf zone, with according bottom changes. In addition, more accurate wave scenarios are needed, especially for the CL+ model, either from measurements or a number of SWAN runs.","","en","student report","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","","","43.404843,28.240826"

(mentor)","2005","Brazil is currently facing widespread problems in the urban environment associated with inadequate systems for drainage of urban stormwater runoff. The PNSB study (2000) identified that out of a total of 5507 municipalities 22% suffered from flooding in the 1998- 1999 period. The majority of problems occurred in the southern states, which have higher rates of urbanisation and higher amounts of rainfall. The problems of urban drainage are compounded by a lack of public awareness and participation, insufficient funds to supply and maintain the basics of sanitation and drainage, weak municipal organisations and a lack of coordination between the different organisations. Traditional master planning has generally failed to address the problems adequately and the implementation of these plans has tended to rely on large-scale costly infrastructure projects, which in some instances have attributed to the worsening of problems, as the stormwater is drained rapidly resulting in the exacerbation of downstream flooding. As a result of the inadequacies of traditional responses, combined with increasing awareness of the need for integrated approaches, a new generation of management plans for urban drainage is emerging. Urban drainage management In recent years some regional capitals have developed an Urban Drainage Master Plan together with appropriate legislation, starting from the premise that newly urbanised spaces should not increase natural surface runoff and that urban drainage must be integrated with planning the urban environment of cities. Experience with the development of Urban Drainage Master Plans showed that institutional and strategic/communicational aspects are essential for the success of the plan and thus deserve special attention. The plan development process in the city of Porto Alegre is a relevant example of that process. This is the main consideration to select the Urban Drainage Master Plan of Porto Alegre as the case study for this master thesis. Using an assessment framework, focusing on relevant criteria concerning both content and process, this study presents an overview of the policy cycle in Porto Alegre, with a focus on the shortcomings and strongpoints of the followed approach in relation to the concept of sustainable development. The objective of this study The overall objective of the study is to improve the approaches for the planning and design of stormwater control solutions in Brazil. From the case study several analyses are possible, which can help to improve the approaches in Porto Alegre and other Brazilian cities. As a first step, critical factors for the success of the plan are identified according to the information and insights that came to light on the basis of the assessment criteria (concept, scope, and knowledge).","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Transport & Planning","","","",""
