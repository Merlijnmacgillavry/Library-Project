(mentor)","2010","Introduction This graduation project has been initiated to research the technical feasibility of floating bridges. The project has been done in co-operation with the FDN engineering company and Delft technical university. A design is made of a continuous pontoon floating bridge, which connects a mainland to an island. Floating bridges can be constructed where conventional bridges are impractical (under the conditions that are described in section 1.4.2). The buoyancy forces support the bridge in the vertical direction and the mooring system in the horizontal direction. The project contains also a survey of the most known floating bridges in the world. Problem definition Which design limitations and structural parameters can ensure stability of the continuous pontoon floating bridge under wind and wave load? Research The objective of this thesis is to understand the response of the continuous pontoon floating bridges under wind-wave load and traffic load that is described in the euro code which enables us to optimize the structural design procedure. That can be accomplished by studying the influence of the pontoon dimensions and the pontoon connector rotational rigidity on the global stability of the bridge. Determination the principles of response reduction and converting the displacement into internal forces are a relevant part of this thesis as well as the mitigating of the local environmental loads to be redistributed along larger parts of the bridge. The scope of the graduation project is very wide. It contains an overview of floating bridges; its hydrodynamic behaviour will be defined and due to the limited period of time will be not analyzed. The hydrostatic behaviour and analysis of continuous pontoon floating bridges will be researched as a multi-body slender structure with flexible connections. Also the conceptual design of the pontoons and the connections and the shape effects were researched. Detailed design calculations for the case study are included in this thesis. Results Environmental loads are the main loading on the floating bridge. Because of the random form of the sea wave forces and the wind force, it is difficult to expect the precise value and direction of loading on the bridge. The environmental loads twist the bridge and excite it in the horizontal and in the vertical direction. When it is possible to construct a sliding pile mooring system to introduce the wind and wave load in the horizontal direction, the floating bridge will have a satisfactory stability. The efficiency of the mooring cable is lower than the sliding pile due to the relatively large compliance range. That is valid also for the vertical displacement; the bridge response will be introduced by the bridge flexural rigidity, the bridge mass, the water spring, the water damping and the pontoon connector stiffness when discrete pontoons are used. The linear theory is applied to determine the sea wave load. The hydro-static and the hydro-dynamic analysis of a multi-body slender structure consisting of rigidly or flexibly connected elements will be made.. The design procedure of the mooring cables of the offshore structure is applied to design the mooring system. Conclusions and recommendations The connection stiffness of the pontoon has a large influence on the bridge response. The ratio connection stiffness over pontoon stiffness is very important for the bridge structural behaviour. When this ratio is smaller than 10-8 the bridge behaves as rigid bodies connected by hinges. When this ratio is larger than 10-3 the bridge behaves as a continuous elastic beam. The largest deflections, moments, and shear forces occur in the ends of the bridge. Additional supports, masses, or dampers at these ends can reduce these moments and forces strongly. Embedment steel crossheads are used to introduce the large mooring line forces without damaging the concrete walls of the pontoons. Further optimization of the pontoon length is recommended. Fatigue of the prestressing steel and the concrete are shown to be critical and need to be further investigated.","floating structure; concrete bridges; multi-body slender structure; mooring system","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Design and Construction","","","",""

(mentor); Sudars, M. (mentor)","2010","Most re-entry vehicles utilize a Descent and Landing System (DLS) for a safe descent through the lowest part of the atmosphere. It usually requires deployment in a certain suitable range of flight conditions, which has to be estimated by limited means of navigation. The investigation performed is a comparison of currently used trigger methods and triggering algorithms which are based on correlation between in-flight measurements and the DLS triggering conditions for a ballistic re-entry vehicle, where the correlations have been extracted by multiple Monte Carlo campaigns. This approach gives an improvement of the estimation of the deployment conditions of a factor of two over direct measurements of the Mach number. The Mach number is determined to be the most critical parameter for the parachute deployment, because its opening range is the smallest compared to the dynamic pressure and the altitude. Furthermore a sensor sensitivity analysis is performed for a lifting entry trajectory in order to support an upcoming ESA re-entry mission. The velocity drift appears to be the dominant dispersion by a factor ten for the Mach estimation, if the Mach estimation is performed by estimating the drag using axial deceleration measurements. Such a method is the preferred method for the estimation of the deployment conditions, because it has an expected error of less than Mach 0.1. For the lifting-re-entry mission, a strategy was developed to have redundant parachute deployment triggering if a certain system on the vehicle fails. This strategy involves the use of an Inertial Measurement Unit, Global Positioning System measurements and as last resort, a static pressure probe. Furthermore it appeared that the vehicle can estimate its state using no inputs from the guidance navigation and control system for four minutes. Finally a case study has been performed to investigate the possibility to reduce the footprint by a dynamic parachute opening window. This has found to be ineffective on Earth, but could be effective for Mars re-entry using a parachute able to deploy beyond Mach 2.5, which would reduce the footprint 15 to 25 kilometers if the NASA MER missions are used as a reference; this would be a reduction of 30 to 50 % of the footprints of current missions. A higher opening velocity is already desired in order to be able to land on the Martian highlands. Modified parachute designs can be developed to incorporate both benefits.","re-entry; parachute","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2010-09-10","Aerospace Engineering","Space Systems Engineering","","","",""

(mentor); Langeveld, L.H. (mentor)","2010","This master thesis shows the development and design of an intrauterine insemination (IUI) device. The graduation project is done by order of the VU medical university in Amsterdam. IUI is a treatment for couples that have problems with their fertility and is conducted by IVF-doctors. Basically the procedure contains the following steps:  Drug treatment, when applicable  Semen collection and preparation  Insemination of the semen via a syringe-catheter combination  Pregnancy test The insemination itself is a non-automated process, with a human factor involved. It appears that every IVF-doctor has her/his own velocity of injection of the semen into the uterus. The injection is not the only step with a human factor, but does seem to be the most important one that can be improved. The main challenge is that a device needs to be developed that controls the step of injection, but with variable velocities and therefore variable flow rates. The device should make it possible to standardize and control the IUI-procedure. The control occurs in different levels. Control has to do with the ability of the user to stabilize the device during the injection. Also, it has to with the technique/driving mechanism used to create a constant force output and therefore a constant velocity output of the syringe. The three injection velocities are 1.5, 2.5 and 3.5 [mm/sec]. The forces that are needed to create these velocities are 0.5, 0.8 and 1.1 [N] respectively. These numbers are based on experimental data and calculations through Bernoulli’s equation. Each force output has a range of minus 0.15 and plus 0.15 [N]. The starting point for the design phases was the search for a driving mechanism that can create the different velocities as mentioned above. Different solutions have been taken into:  Air pressure  Magnetic repulsion  Spring  Constant force spring When looking at the force output, only the ‘constant force spring’ fits inside the range. So this mechanism seems to be the best solution for the IUI device. The force output of the constant force spring depends on the material, thickness and the width. Basically, the manufacturer determines the force output of these springs and it’s not possible to choose the force output that fits inside the required range. Instead, a higher force output is chosen. The idea is to put the constant force spring inside a piston. This piston comes with o-rings that glide inside a tube. By making use of the friction of the rubber inside the hole of the tube, the force output can be controlled. When the diameter of this hole is reduced, then a higher load is applied to the rubber, resulting in a higher friction. By changing the diameter, three force outputs can be created. The device has two major functions:  Locking and unlocking of the piston  Attaching of the syringe Based on these functions, several solutions are presented. One of the solutions are chosen, which is done by the use of the Harris profile.","IUI; design; device; standardization","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Design Engineering","","Master specialisation Medisign","",""

Hence it limits the European Union goal to form a unique electricity market while liberalization is spread. Moreover, congestion could jeopardize the benefits of liberalization, like it happened in California and in England, where Producers manipulated the market by bidding strategically, in other words, they withheld capacity and/or ordered higher prices than marginal cost.

Current solutions like reputation systems and sharing ratio enforcement are complex, exploitable, inaccurate or unfair at times. The need to design scalable mechanisms that mitigate such problems is evident. We demonstrate through measurements that BitTorrent peers are able to barter pieces of different files (indirect interaction) which is a previously unknown property of the BitTorrent protocol. We introduce a centralized extension for the BitTorrent protocol which we refer to as the indirect interaction mechanism (IIM). IIM incentivizes seeding and mitigates problems of unfairness and exploitation while at the same time achieving linear scalability. We provide game theoretical models of the mechanism and demonstrate through analysis and simulations that IIM improves BitTorrent performance for certain cases and that it does not degrade performance for others. We conclude that IIM is a practical solution to the fundamental problem of P2P networks like BitTorrent.","BitTorrent; P2P; Mechanism Design; Incentive; Seed; game theory; model","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Computer Science","","Computer Science / Algorithmics","",""

(mentor); Roscam Abbing, E. (mentor)","2010","Project background Ever since its founding in 1905, Red Wing Shoe Company operates from the town of Red Wing, Minnesota in the US. The company started in the industrial footwear business, and has expanded with two more business fields over the years; Outdoor sports shoes and Lifestyle. In 2000, Red Wing Shoe Company introduced the heritage line, a selection of old worker-boots inspired designs, under the brand Red Wing Shoes in the European lifestyle market. Today, Red Wing Shoes offers the lifestyle boots in twelve European countries. European brand development is currently in differing stages per country. Overall, the European lifestyle department is unprofitable to this point. In order to increase sales, Red Wing Shoes needs to find increased connection to the target consumers. The research question for this project is: How can the brand Red Wing Shoes can get connected to its target consumers in the European market. Therefore, consumer touchpoints are designed, i.e. the channels for interaction between brand and consumer (Wheeler, 2009). Research activities Research defined what message the brand should reflect outward to affect the target consumer and where and how the brand should communicate in order to reach them. The research as performed is divided by three domains. Internal analysis, External analysis and Touchpoint analysis. Based on data analysis, the brand proposition is developed, stating the main benefits consumers derive from the brand in the European market. In order to actualize this proposition, guiding principles for brand behaviour are put up in a brand manifest. An idea-generation session with the target group is performed to generate ideas on how touchpoints can connect the brand to the target consumer. Based on the ideas, seven concepts were developed. Criteria distilled from research led to the selection of one concept for detail design. This concept was detailed guided by the brand manifest to ensure it contributes to the actualization of the brand proposition. Results Red Wing Shoes proposes independency and integrity as the main benefits consumers derive from the brand. Marketing should thereby mainly focus on men between 26 and 34. This category undergoes a transition in which they grow independent from peers and need to make choices in their lifes. Red Wing Shoes independence and integrity facilitates this transition. Two brand assets are mainly important for the brand to make explicit. The brand’s craftsmen are an authentic asset which should be shown to prove authenticity of the company. Brand communication should shift emphasis from history to heritage as the heritage provides reassurance for consumers. Besides proving the authenticity, Red Wing Shoes should involve loyal consumers in the brand’s conversations. Consumers eventually determine the brand meaning, i.e. the symbolic resonance and today’s relevance. The most important touchpoints consumers consult are the brand website, independent blogs and websites, the retailer and other consumers. The design process aimed to integrate these touchpoints in the final design. The premium prices combined with little brand awareness among consumers create a high risk perception regarding the purchase of a pair of Red Wings. Therefore, consumers often conduct more research on the brand prior to purchase. It is therefore important to create and maintain brand touchpoints inside and outside the retail environment. How Furthermore, the design should facilitate regular innovation. Innovation is important to nourish relations with retailers and agents. Establising good B2B relationships nurtures and maintains the current distribution channel, which provides the brand with a competitive advantage over direct competitors. Second, innovation keeps up attention from bloggers who post on the brand and thereby advertise the brand towards consumers. The European department has a limited marketing budget. Therefore, the objective was to limit the costs for the design. Combining the need for innovation with the limited budget led to the design requirement to facilitate innovation over multiple seasons. Further, realisation and implementation should be feasible with current manpower. Final design The final design is an exhibition of a brand asset displayed in-store and online. Twice a year, a new exhibition exposes an other brand asset. The first two exhibitions expose the consumers and the craftsmen. This innovation stimulates bloggers and independent websites to post on the brand regularly and nourishes the relations with retailers and agents. By creating a platform which facilitates regular innovation over six seasons, the costs for the touchpoints per season are limited.","Branding; Consumer lifestyle","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Product Innovation Management","","","",""

We investigate different methods of integrating position and orientation data of moving real-world objects and individuals into a virtual environment, and of simulating their interaction with virtual objects and individuals. This simulation requires accurate measurements of positional data of dynamic real-world objects. This data is then represented in a virtual copy of the real-world environment. One or more user-controlled virtual objects are added and interaction with this environment is made possible. We investigate different ways of manipulating the avatars of real-world objects to simulate this interaction. Each such method must be guaranteed to smoothly recover to an exact copy of the real-world situation in all but the most extreme circumstances. An accurate prediction of both the future state of the real world and the users avatar is needed to plan these manipulations ahead of time. Different prediction methods are researched, for both the real-world objects and the user object. We give an overview of the flow and manipulation of information through a system that allows for such simulated interaction, and conclude that integration of and interaction with real-world objects in a virtual environment is very well possible, but that each application may have specific needs based on parameters such as relative velocity and maneuverability. This results in the necessity of selecting a specific solution for each individual stage of the information flow for each application.","Virtual Environments; User Tracking; Motion Prediction","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2010-12-28","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Computer Science","","Computer Science","",""

Based on the multiple sampling method, the method described in this thesis uses the special feature of the pinned photodiode to select the charge transfer time locally to change the total integration time in one frame based on the input light intensity. The comparator is reused during the different conversion phases to save power and area. Only one comparison is needed after each charge transfer, so compared with traditional multiple sampling method for DR enhancement this method can save a lot of power. In-pixel memory is used to store the converted data, and these data are read by column wise current sense amplifiers. The simulation results show that the charge transfer of the pinned photo diode is controlled locally and for a 7-bit dynamic range enhancement the additional power is only 2.2% compared with no DR enhancement.","Pixel ADC; smart pixel; dynamic range enhancement; multiple sampling","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Microelectronics & Computer Engineering","","Microelectronics","",""

(mentor)","2010","Optical networks employing the wavelength division multiplexing (WDM) technology are promising solutions to the ever increasing demand for bandwidth. The use of WDM allows aggregation of many channels onto a single fibre without the need of high speed optoelectronic devices for end users. In WDM networks, as the optical signals traverse multiple links their quality deteriorates due to the physical impairments they encounter. This necessitates regeneration of the signals at the intermediate nodes so that the signals will reach the destination with an acceptable level of quality. In addition, due to the frequent occurrence of fiber cuts and the tremendous amount of data transported, survivability, which is the ability to reconfigure and reestablish communication upon failure, is indispensable in WDM networks. Survivability is of critical importance in high-speed optical communication networks. These days, network survivability along with impairment-aware routing is of great interest to telecommunication system vendors, service providers and end users. This thesis work focuses on solving impairment-aware survivable routing in WDM networks. We have proposed and implemented exact and heuristic algorithms that solve survivable regenerator placement and survivable impairment-aware routing problems in WDM networks.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2010-09-09","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Computer Engineering","","Network Architectures and Services","",""

Instead, a hot-air balloon floating through Titan’s atmosphere, as proposed in the Titan Saturn System Mission (TSSM) to ESA, appears to be the ideal in-situ element for the desired science goals. The haze particles can be studied by an instrument on the balloon’s gondola that measures sunlight that has been scattered by the haze particles. We present SPEX, the Spectropolarimeter for Planetary EXploration, as an instrument to retrieve information on the number density, composition, size and shape of the haze particles. As payload on the TSSM balloon, SPEX would measure simultaneously the radiance and degree and direction of linear polarization of scattered sunlight with wavelengths from about 0.4 to 0.8 µm. In particular the degree of linear polarization of this light is known to be very sensitive to the microphysical properties (size, shape, composition) of the scattering particles. SPEX has originally been designed as Mars orbiter payload, with 7 fixed downward- and 2 fixed limb-viewing apertures.","Titan; SPEX; balloon mission","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2010-09-24","Aerospace Engineering","Space Engineering","","Astrodynamics & Space Missions","",""

Water contact angle measurements and permeation experiments using a protein solution were conducted to evaluate the change of hydrophilicity and anti-fouling properties. Salt rejection tests were performed to evaluate membrane performance. A reduction in contact angles from 32 o to 7 o was achieved for the treated membranes, indicating enhanced hydrophilicity. The permeation experiments revealed that the modified membranes achieved an excellent maintenance of flux compared to the untreated membranes. Specifically, after 210 minutes of filtration, no flux decline was found for the modified membranes, while a 27% reduction of the initial flux was observed for the untreated membrane. Flux recovery after cleaning by water only was up to 99.5% for the modified membranes, while for the untreated it was only 91.0%.

(mentor); Bakker, H.L.M. (mentor); Veeneman, W.W. (mentor); Rodenburg, P.P. (mentor); Dimos, M. (mentor)","2010","Putting effort into the early project phases in order to prepare optimally for project delivery is labelled Front-End development (FED). For projects, an optimum has to be found where FED is performed in a way that it increases the chance on successful project delivery, without losing cost competiveness. The results of this research can be used to reduce the amount of activities that have to be performed without missing the critical FED activities. Therefore the predictability and the value of the project outcome will be increased. In this study the relationships between activities performed in the FED phase and project success were investigated. For the current research a data set from previous research was used to perform a new multivariate analysis. This data set included the results of surveys that were distributed to project managers in the member companies of the NAP network, a competence network of the Dutch process industry. Data were obtained from 67 projects performed in the NAP network. These data were analyzed using multivariate statistical techniques. The multivariate analysis identified important correlations between FED activities and project success. But more importantly, the second step in this research was to get hold of the identified FED activities and what they entailed. Therefore scientific literature was explored and hypotheses were derived. Thereafter five cases were selected and subsequently 11 interviews were conducted. Based on the interviews case summaries were made and compared by means of a cross-case analysis. The results of this analysis were used to test the hypotheses. In the studied cases, the activities team design (collaborative project teams), goal setting, monitoring and OIP were implemented according to the best practices available in literature. Collaborative teams beneficially contributed to project success as it increased efficiency and were therefore directly related to the increasing chance of a project being successful. Based on the findings of this research it seems likely that trust and the composition of a team based on competencies also have to be taken into account when designing a team. Applying OIP is directly related to an increased chance of delivering a project successful. The benefits due to the involvement of other parties such as Operations and Maintenance early in the project, are a higher standard of preparations and installations. Operators are prepared and equipment is installed correctly, resulting in reduced start-up time and steady state production. Clearly defined business objectives and involvement of the project team in the process of defining, resulted in acceptance and alignment. Monitoring of project goals was an important means to keep on track. In conclusion the above findings reinforce the suggestion that these activities directly increase the chance of a project being delivered successfully. Two activities were implemented to a lesser extent than described in the literature: risk and stakeholder management. Regarding stakeholder management, it appeared that success was gained by use of an informal form of stakeholder management. The same issues (identifying, prioritizing and engaging with stakeholders) are addressed there although not formally put in a procedure. Successful informal practices were the integration of stakeholders in the project governance structure and the facilitation of frequent meetings with them. Both practices enabled alignment and reduced delays and conflicts. Implementing formal stakeholder management procedures provides opportunities to improve them. Organizations are obliged to pay attention to the stakeholders involved and therefore reduce even more conflicts and delays; especially in dynamic project environments with a long duration, many stakeholders, and when young project managers are involved. Regarding risk management it seems that companies have various tools and methods in place. Some implicitly implement risk management practices within the various processes, especially when defining the business case and user requirements. From these processes the subsequent allocation of actions and the implicit identification of risk owners followed. Others had more systematic formal risk management procedures in place. It appeared that the successful application of risk management likely depends on choosing the right risk management method/procedure dependent on the project environment. Furthermore a reflection on the available data resulted in the following finding: it is more important to obtain alertness, in order to be truly able to anticipate on project dynamics than to codify risks formally. However formally codifying the risks is recommended when many job movements occur during a project lifecycle. External benchmarking significantly contributed to project success according to the statistical analysis. Although not many cases applied external benchmarking, we are able to conclude that benchmarking has the potential to increase projects success. The reason for this is that benchmarking makes it possible to anticipate early in the project on unexpected occurrences. During the course of this research, it became clear that people are the most critical elements of delivering a project successfully. It interrelates with all the FED activities. When taking a helicopter view, it appears that trust (between the team members and between the contractor and project owner), alertness (to anticipate on the alternations in the project environment) and acceptance (towards organizational change) are important human factors, which can influence successful application of the FED activities and have a high chance of influencing project success. This research recommends having integrated project teams with the same contractor during FED and project delivery, Global Framework Agreements and less job movements during a project life cycle as this can influence trust and alertness. Furthermore it is recommended to actively share experiences and information. Possible solutions to share information are to appoint mentors, to launch educational and development programs and, maybe more important, organize lunch and learn sessions. This research concludes with recommendations for future research. Important for future research is to explore different contracting strategies that support collaboration during the FED phases between contractors and project owners and to identify cost savings as a result of long term collaboration.","front-end Loading; project success; team design; goal setting; external benchmarking; Operation Implementation Planning; monitoring; stakeholder management; risk management; front-end development; trust; acceptance; alertness; contracting; knowledge sharing; Global Framework Agreements","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","2010-08-18","Technology, Policy and Management","Section of Technology, Strategy and Entrepreneurship","","Management of Technology","",""

Its accelerated development in two stages (1850s- 1930s and 1950s-1989) generated a superposition of fragmented urban projects (signs of various stages of modernity) that were never finished. These stages in its evolution were generated by advances in technology and therefore the reformulation of the infrastructural framework, and changes in the perception of open-spaces as main arenas of publicness. After 1989, the inability of the City to produce a new infrastructural paradigm and its careless treatment of the open-space through market speculation produced chaotic development, extreme fragmentation, lack of public space, and last but most important, the lack of public trust in planners. With this problem setting in mind there are a few questions that become the backbone of this thesis: How could we use infrastructure and open-space to describe the future of Bucharest? Can they act as frameworks to produce a new paradigm for the city? Can Bucharest become a testing ground for conjectures that become relevant at a wider scale? These are the main questions to which this thesis research should be able to answer. By developing conjectures illustrating how Bucharest could be shaped around infrastructure and open-space, the ambition of this work is to produce guidelines and tools for an isotropic and permeable Bucharest.","Bucharest; infrastructure; urban structure","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Architecture","Urbanism","","EMU","",""

(mentor)","2010","The purpose of this master project is to implement the Wang-O'Gara-Tucker model to simulate the fiber orientation in fiber filled injection molded thermoplastics. A part of the extensive fundamental theory behind this model, and the implementations are treated in Part I of the thesis, the theory part. This part consists of the first eight chapters. In Chapter 1 an introduction to the thesis is given. Certain preliminaries to understand the scope and purpose of the project are treated. These preliminaries include the process of injection molding, the use of fiber filled thermoplastics, fiber orientation, past research, available commerical software, the interest of DSM in the subject of fiber orientation, the research method and approach and the contribution of this thesis. In Chapter 2 the notation and conventions used throughout this report are treated. As is a selection of the mathematical preliminaries. Chapter 3 starts off with the theory behind Jeffery's equation, a deterministic model for the fiber orientation of a single ellipsoidal particle in a fully viscous/Stokes flow. This model is extended by Folgar and Tucker with the addition of a fiber-fiber interaction term, using a probability density function. In Chapter 4 an approach using only partial information of the computationally inefficient Folgar-Tucker model is introduced. Chapter 5 treats the model that is the focus of this thesis, the Wang-O'Gara-Tucker model. It slows down the kinetics of the Folgar-Tucker model to adapt the theoretical results to the experimental results. In Chapter 6 the closure problem of the Folgar-Tucker tensor form is explained. Chapter 7 thoroughly treats the Fokker- Planck equation that stems from the Folgar-Tucker probability density form. A numerical scheme is derived to obtain a solution. In Chapter 8 a numerical scheme for solving the tensor form of the Folgar-Tucker model is derived. Should one not be interested in mathematical details, then proofs can be skipped easily. The idea of the models can be understood even without such details. If one is merely interested in the results of the implementation of the model, then Part I can be skipped entirely. The results are contained in Part II. Part II uses the implementations of Chapters 7 and 8 to model the fiber orientation for a simple shear flow field in Chapter 9 and for a uniaxial elonational flow in Chapter 10. Results of the probability density are interpreted for different parameter sets. The approximations of the tensor form are compared to the solutions of the probability density, using several closure relations. Part III concludes the theory and test models with conclusions and recommendations for future research. Part IV consists of some 'classical' proofs, instructions for the codes that were used to obtain the results in the thesis, the bibliography and the nomenclature. The classical proofs were put in the appendix to make sure that only information specific to the modeling of fiber orientation with the Wang-O'Gara-Tucker model is included in the main parts. With the addition of the instruction of the implementations to the thesis, it is intended to make the thesis offer an integrated approach to the Wang-O'Gara-Tucker model: the theory is presented, two test cases as examples are considered and the usage of the implementations is explained.","Wang-O'Gara-Tucker Model; fiber orientation; thermoplastics","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2011-01-06","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Precision and Microsystems Engineering","","","",""

(mentor); Dijkema, G.P.J. (mentor); Van der Heijden, J.J. (mentor)","2010","Dutch households consume 20% of the total energy used in the country and therefore targeted by decision makers to reduce their fossil fuel dependence and carbon emission attributed to them (“Energy mix”, 2007; CBS, 2008.). Different technical systems such as solar panel, micro-Combined Heat and Power (micro-CHP), efficient appliance and bulbs, insulators, solar boiler and heat pump can be used for residential households in order to reduce the environmental impact of their energy consumption and to secure energy. These measures are called sustainable energy systems as they either reduce total energy use or generate energy from renewable energy sources such as sunlight, air, geothermal heat, water and etc. The effectiveness of the systems may depend on the way households consume energy and it may not be the same for all households even if they have the same energy demand over the year. Therefore, we questioned that “does households’ energy consumption behavior influence the performance of household sustainable energy systems? If so, what actions should be taken by the government to increase the performance? The aim of the thesis is to investigate whether or not households’ energy consumption behavior influences the performance of sustainable energy systems; and to give recommendation for policy makers on future direction and effective implementation of the systems. The question is addressed by modeling different energy demand patterns. Statistical model, gamma distribution, is used to model different electricity demand pattern for different households that have the same average energy demand but; 1) different electricity consumption variance (high or low) and; 2) different peak demand hours over the day (in daytime or in early morning and in the evening). The performance of a sustainable energy system, solar panel, is then compared between them using performance criteria measures such as electricity bill, money saved, percentage of electricity demand covered from the grid and percentage of solar electricity supply used at home. The result shows that grid dependence and electricity bill increases with increasing electricity consumption variance; however, the difference between high and low consumption variance is very small. Likewise peak electricity demand in early morning and in the evening leads to higher grid dependency and electricity bill compared to households that consume their most energy in the daytime though the difference is small in the Netherlands. The difference in grid dependence and electricity bill due to variation of peak demand hours is higher than the differences due to consumption variance. In general, the effect of energy consumption variation on the performance of solar panel from the considered electricity demand patterns is small in the Netherlands; however this may not be true when the efficiency of solar panel is improved in the future; in other countries that have longer sunny season; for other energy demand patterns not considered in this thesis and for other sustainable systems. Therefore, we recommend further research on these areas. From the current result the government can still reduce the effect of consumption variation either by encouraging technologies that can store energy during low demand time and /or by influencing the behavior of the households. The behavior of the household can be influenced by using incentive or creating awareness about the effect of energy demand variation and by giving recommendation for optimal way of energy consumption like reducing simultaneous use of electrical devices.","energy demand pattern; household; sustainable energy systems; performance measures; statistical model","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Technology, Policy and Management","Infrastructure Systems & Services","","Engineering and Policy Analysis- Energy and Industry Section","",""

This report describe a public transport study for Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, with an overall objective of developing a public transit service network that satisfies current and future city travel demand, but also is easier for the passenger to understand and use. The motivation is to contribute to the proposed city's initiatives towards improving the public transport through the Dar es Salaam Bus Rapid Transit (DART) project. The project aims at improving the infrastructure for commuters in the city and alleviating the problems within the existing bus system locally know as ""Dala dala"". The study includes an inventory on the city's demography and urban development dynamics, as well as an assessment of the current public transport system and its supporting infrastructure. Then, it proposes improvement in organization and infrastructure for a new public transport system service network for the city and analyzes possible implementation strategies. To improve the quality of the public transport system in Dar es Salaam, changes are required in the network and organization. A two layer network is proposed, including a high level which will be operated on the dedicated busways or Bus Rapid Transit using high capacity buses to transport passengers between the high demand areas and the lower level which will operate in mixed traffic by collecting and distributing passengers in the community and at the same time transporting passengers within the sub-networks of the lower level network. The design methodology developed by TNO Inro (Institute for Traffic and Transportation, Logistic and Spatial Development of The Netherlands) in collaboration with Delft University of Technology is used in the design and distinction of the two network levels. The proposed two level networks will be integrated in terms of system services organization, networks and infrastructure to provide the benefits of a truly modern public transport.","Bus Rapid Transit; BRT; Public Transport; Demand Analysis; Network Design; Network Levels; Implementation Strategies","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Transport & Planning","","","",""

It is programs or environment or resources employed by corporations to maintain its strategic position, avoid its mainstream business becoming obsolete, explore new businesses, or simply to gain more financially. Due to the stream of new venture ideas, before the development of these new venture starts, corporate business incubators need to carefully select which ideas are to be pursued in their portfolio in order to avoid bad investments. A corporate business incubator’s environment is largely influenced by the economic and strategic situations of its mother organization. Its portfolio’s objectives are, in most cases, steered towards gaining a strategic advantage for its mother organization. Therefore, it has to flexibly adjust itself to follow the direction of its mother organization. In organizing its portfolio, corporate business incubators typically utilize a certain process, where ongoing venture projects are selected, monitored and assessed throughout different stages of development process. Often, venture ideas change its target market/consumer, revenue streams, or even the whole business model through the different stages. This is quite normal, however, in a dynamic environment such as that of a corporate business incubator’s, where impact of changes always need to be assessed towards the fit with the mother organization’s current economic and business situation, the validity of go/no-go decisions at each end of stage becomes crucial. In this thesis we perform a designing approach on how to support decision makers of a corporate business incubator in making evidence-based go/no-go decisions that take the dynamic environment of the incubator into account in order to have viable and feasible venture projects in the portfolio. More specifically, this paper focuses on two central questions: (i) What are the problems of a corporate business incubator’s portfolio selection (ii) How to select and manage a corporate business incubator’s portfolio with the objective of generating viable and feasible venture projects. The study is performed at ABN AMRO’s business incubator, The Dialogues Incubator, located in Amsterdam, The Netherlands. Our methods include an exploration of the literature in the related topics namely business incubators, portfolio management, New Product Development (NPD), New Service Development (NSD), venture capital (VC) and decision support systems (DSS).

The results of both studies will be collaborated into a proposal of a decision making framework and decision criteria for the go/no-go decisions. In parallel, a proof of concept in a form of software will be developed. This proof of concept will complement the proposed framework to support decision makers with evidences/information when making decisions. The evaluation and implementation of the proposed framework and the accompanying decision support tool have yet to be performed, which implicates a future study.","business incubators; portfolio management; decision support system","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Technology, Policy and Management","Management of Technology","","ICT","",""

(mentor); Margallo Balbás, E. (mentor)","2010","Photodynamic therapy (PDT) can be used to treat all kinds of (pre-)malignant and non malignant cells, and has some great advantages in comparison with conventional treatments, like radiotherapy and chemotherapy. To be able to perform PDT one needs three things to be present in a cell: photosensitizer, light of a specific wavelength, and oxygen. A photosensitizer is a specially designed drug that that is activated by light of a specific wavelength. When activated, the photosensitizer reacts with oxygen, which leads to cell death. The cell death can occur in two ways: necrosis and apoptosis. A new type of PDT has been introduced recently in the treatment of brain tumors, which is called metronomic PDT (mPDT). The principle of mPDT is similar to that of PDT, but the difference is the length of the treatment. mPDT works with a lower light dose and a longer treatment time compared to conventional PDT. This ensures that the cells dies in a natural way (apoptosis) and do not cause inflammations, which happens in normal PDT. To be able to perform mPDT on a human brain, it is necessary that the treatment can be monitored. For this purpose information on the state of the photosensitizer is necessary. An important aspect of the photosensitizer is the fluorescence, which occurs upon light absorption by the photosensitizer and is related to electronic transition from an excited state to the ground state of the used molecule. From the fluorescence reflection spectrum one can determine the concentration and interaction with cells, as well as localisation and configuration of the photosensitizer. The photosensitizers used for the treatment have a lifetime from 3.5ns to 10ns. To measure the lifetime of the photosensitizer we need to be able to reconstruct the exponential decay of the fluorescence reflection spectrum. In order to do this we use a LED to excite the photosensitizer and a photodiode for detection of the fluorescence reflection spectrum. We integrate the photocurrent on the parasitic capacitor of the photodiode, to make sure the system is fast. When the signal is integrated once, it holds no usable information other than the total charge integrated. For this purpose a tune-able delay circuit has been designed that can delay the beginning of the measurement, which allows us to change the integration window. If we now integrate the same signal several times, while changing the starting time for each integration, we can reconstruct the exponential decay of the fluorescence reflection spectrum. The designed chip houses the timing circuit for the tune-able delay, as well as a photodiode for light detection, and an amplifier to amplify the signal enough for readout with an AD-converter. There is also space for a LED on the chip, which is also controlled by the timing circuit to ensure correct on and off switching of the LED. The chip is designed in such a way that it can work with a external light source as well. The measurements are done without a photosensitizer because they are to expansive to use before proper testing of the chips has been completed. Instead of a photosensitizer the switching behaviour of the LED is used to determine the chips behaviour. The delay circuit works as designed. However we where not able to measure the delays that are created. We where able to show that the chip functions in the a way that is similar to what is expected.","Time Resolved Fluorescence; Fluorescence","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2010-08-31","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Electronic Instrumentation","","Master Thesis","",""

(mentor); Bidarra, A.R. (mentor)","2010","Under the pressure of competition and the expectations of consumers, game developers are in a race to create the biggest and most detailed worlds in their productions. Nowadays, thanks to the evolution of computer hardware, great amounts of detail to be put in those worlds, and this trend is not expected to end any time soon. But that detail has to be created by hand most of the time and that is becoming a very costly activity, to such an extent even that it is becoming unprofitable. Cannibal Game Studios develops software to make content creation easier and more cost-efficient, and from that company came the assignment for this work. This work focuses on the creation of one particular type of content: architectural structures. The goal of this work is stated as follows: Create an approach and a prototype system that will speed up the creation of architectural structures. The first part of the work consisted of researching two related subjects and developing an approach based on the findings of the research. The first is the domain of architectural structure creation. The research explores the process of architectural structure creation and the problems that exist in it. The development of a new approach should not only solve the problems, but it should also fit in with the existing processes and design principles. Through interviews with game developers in the Netherlands, an understanding was gained of these matters and a set of requirements was created that the approach should fulfill. The second subject of research pertains to the existing approaches that have been developed to solve the identified problems. The most relevant existing approaches are based on procedures and a selection of those approaches is reviewed in order to discover their strengths and weaknesses. While all approaches have their benefits, they also exhibit several shortcomings. With the development of a new approach that satisfies the requirements of the games industry, it is important to use their benefits in our advantage and to keep their shortcomings in mind in order to provide a more complete solution. This led to the inception of an instance-based modeling approach that allows users to specify procedures for the design of a structure through (real-time) interaction with a special instance of that design. In this approach, designs are specified and instances of the design can be created by a procedural system. The approach defines structures in terms of components and relations between those components. The instantiation process for the instance of a structure instantiates, forms, and positions instances of components based on their relation definitions to other components. The approach uses patterns to govern the repeated instantiation of components. Patterns are used in a similar fashion to select component instances as parents for instantiated connections relations. One of the most interesting concepts of the approach is that it allows components to have non-hierarchic relations to several other components. This approach shields the user from coding abstract rules and presents a familiar 3D modeling interface instead. In the second part of this work, a prototype system was implemented based on this new approach. This was done based on the software framework of Cannibal Game Studios, which includes a 3D game Engine and a content editor framework. For the prototype, it was decided to use connections as the relations between components of a structure, and curves as the component shape type to use. During the development of the prototype, it became apparent that the procedural instantiation logic was much more complex to create than anticipated. It proved to be the biggest challenge in the project to keep instances of a component up-to-date in real-time when the design of the component was modified. The result of this work is in the first place a new approach for Computer-Aided Design for architectural structures that allows users to create procedural structure designs in a non-technical way. It also allows users to easily create and work with non-hierarchical relations between components in the design. In the second place it has led to the creation of a prototype system that serves as a proof of concept for this approach. Although the prototype is not complete enough to be considered a usable product, it does prove that an implementation of the proposed approach can actually be realized. Aside from the complete approach, even the individual concepts of the approach that were implemented in the system have value to the content creation process. Future work can be performed in two ways. The first is to improve the current implementation by making it more efficient and by adding more features. These features would include more interaction functionality to make the system more user-friendly, and more functional features to make it more flexible and complete. Some examples of the latter are the implementation of more shape types and more relation types. The second way in which future work can be done is to develop the approach itself further. For instance, other ways of relation specification can be explored on both the technical and the user interface level.","procedural; architectural; structure; modeling; instance","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Mediamatics","","Computer Graphics and CAD/CAM Group","",""

A possible way to enhance the safety is by using natural convection as the driving mechanism for the coolant flow. Natural convection is especially interesting because of the large differences in density occurring under supercritical conditions. This is safer because of its independence of mechanical systems (i.e. pumps, which are used in forced convection loops). The goal of this project was to investigate the linear stability of a one-dimensional, simplified version of the HPLWR (without the power-density feedback, but with constant power) around the steady-state solution for a range of operational conditions. A code was written based on one-dimensional equations for mass, energy and momentum transport. The code successfully predicted the steady-state behaviour of a system. The results were benchmarked with data from literature. The code works for natural convection loops as well as forced convection systems. The stability plots do not agree with literature and are therefore considered to be incorrect.","nuclear energy; SCWR; HPLWR; stability; natural convection","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","Applied Sciences","Radiation, Radionuclides & Reactors (R3)","","BSc Technische Natuurkunde","",""

Able to provide medium to high-resolution measurements over large areas, it is the link between the low-resolution satellite measurements and expensive terrestrial campaigns, especially in remote areas. To explore the potential of airborne gravimetry, the Gravimetry using Airborne Inertial Navigation (GAIN) project was recently established at the faculty of Aerospace Engineering at TU-Delft, and is currently building and testing an in-house strapdown airborne gravimetry system with the objective of providing low-cost, high-accuracy gravity data for use in a wide range of applications in geodesy and geophysics. Within this thesis, the inertial sensors that will be used within the GAIN strapdown IMU are calibrated and modeled with a simulator to predict the accuracy of the airborne system when completed. A sensitivity study of several campaign parameters is done to understand which parts of the hardware and operating conditions are critical to the performance of the system. Of the list of applications for airborne gravity data, natural resource exploration is one of the more demanding in terms of accuracy and resolution, with a requirement of 0.5-2mGal at 2km resolution. This is beyond the range of current strapdown systems, so in addition to assessing the performance of the current strapdown system, additional tests were made to see what would be needed to achieve this higher level of accuracy. The simulation results suggest that the performance of the GAIN strapdown system, under ideal conditions, would be 1.4mGal at 2km resolution. Furthermore, the performance is limited by the accelerometers whose accuracy must improve by a factor of three before the 0.5mGal level can be achieved; however, other options were identified that could also be used to achieve this.","airborne gravimetry; inertial navigation; IMU calibration; simulation; sensitivity analysis","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2012-08-15","Aerospace Engineering","Department of Remote Sensing","","Physical and Space Geodesy","",""

(mentor); Visch, V. (mentor)","2010","A breast cancer diagnosis and undergoing cancer treatment is often obtrusive into someone’s life. Breast cancer patients are facing an uncertain future and are dealing with side-effects of treatment. Over the years, many studies have been executed to map the emotional responses and the assessment of their ‘Quality of Life’ (QoL) over time. Different types of psychological interventions and communication-oriented services have been developed to help patients to adjust to their disease and treatment, but less attention has been paid to a product that may supplement current services or may execute psychological interventions in the personal environment of a patient. Breast cancer patients and breast cancer survivors, e.g. possible users of the prospective product, were involved in different studies to collect different levels of knowledge on the experience of breast cancer patients and their context to be able to design an appropriate emotion-based product. Such an emotion-based product should contribute by helping patients to adjust to their disease, deal with their emotions and improve their QoL over time. In this research project exploratory interviews gave insight into the (dominant) emotions and the emotional difficult situations in the daily life of breast cancer patients. Generative sessions were executed to gain in-depth knowledge about concerns, feelings, and attitudes breast cancer patients have from the moment they are diagnosed with cancer, concerning the past, present and future. Results of these studies show that the period after finishing treatments is indicated as the heaviest period since the cancer diagnosis. Breast cancer survivors are not able to fulfil expectations of themselves or from other people. Mostly, falling short of these expectations is caused by a lack of energy and power to undertake actions. Also the attention of other people will decrease from the moment breast cancer patients become breast cancer survivors, this may result in a feeling that they are let down by others. Many studies show that tiredness is one of the most common side effects of cancer treatment and may persist for months or even years after completion of breast cancer treatment. The important difference between tiredness after cancer and normal tiredness is that the gravity of the tiredness of breast cancer survivors is not in proportion with respect to the performed activity and effort cannot be objectively measured. The experience of the tiredness can only be subjectively assessed and communicated by the cancer survivor. The proposed emotion-based product connects perfectly to the subjective approach of the energy management of breast cancer survivors. The product contains of different beads, which represent different activities. By means of wiring the beads on a string, the user of the product will be able to assess the expected energy flow of the different activities within a day. The evaluation of activities will support the user to become an expert of her own energy management, to get insight into the course and moments the tiredness appears and express her emotions. This product aims to increase the sense of the self-well-being of breast cancer survivors and to make them conscious about their daily life planning. Setting goals for undertaking some (simple) activities or relaxing moments will support these women to manage their energy level and tiredness. By means of a physical visualization of their daily life activities and energy management, this product makes them become more aware of their daily life planning in a playful way. In addition this product enables them to indicate and communicate their emotions and energy usage to others. Evaluation interviews gave insight into the usability of the product and the user experience of the proposed emotion-based product. They also gave an indication of the possibilities for the use of this product in the field of cancer rehabilitation. Results of these studies show that this emotion-based product was well received by prospective users and experts in the field of cancer rehabilitation. Customization of the product by a prospective user was the main recommendation result of this study. Both parties indicated that the proposed emotion-based product has high potential to support people with their energy management, not only in the field of breast cancer, but also for other diagnosis, such as chronic pain and burn out.","emotions; cancer; quality of life; qualitative research","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","2011-08-27","Industrial Design Engineering","Industrial Design","","Design for Interaction","",""

(mentor); Gemser, G. (mentor)","2010","This report presents the studies, findings and advices for the market introduction of Culinique. Culinique is a new ready-to-eat meal product based on a revolutionary packaging concept, CuliDish, and the Slowfood principle. The technology of CuliDish controls intensity of microwaves in a microwave oven and therefore controls the heating process of food products in such packaging. This causes products to be heated less rigorous and prevent negative influences to quality and taste. This enables Maître Leon to offer more luxurious and culinary ready-to-eat meals with high quality ingredients, that would normally be spoiled by heating in the microwave oven. The Slowfood principles are based on the general believe that people should enjoy food more and should choose products more carefully. Slowfood aims to use regional and biological products, no additives and preservatives and high quality ingredients. The goal is to stimulate healthy eating behaviour and a overall pleasurable and enjoyable meal, in contrast to fastfood that is unhealthy, little enjoyable and of poor quality. Maître Leon has asked me to further develop these concepts into a product and study the market possibilities. Internal analyses, including a product study has led to a redesign of the current CuliDish containers and to a list of unique selling points that need to sustain in order for the product to become, and remain successful. These unique selling points are: 1) Unique CuliDish technology for precise heating 2) Superior food quality based on the Slowfood principle 3) Food preparation by chefs instead of machines 4) Separate containers to prevent tastes and smells to mix 5) Freedom to compose a meal from components 6) Wide assortment for sufficient variety Therefore it is advised to Maître Leon to control the pace of growth of Culinique. To rapid growth is likely to cause harm to the USP’s that make the product special. External studies and market explorations in the (health)care sector, the small catering sector and the market of company restaurants led to the conclusion that the (health)care market should be the primary focus of Culinique, at market introduction. The clients of care organisations are dissatisfied with the current food facilitation and many organisations have difficulties to find alternatives at reasonable prices. The (health)care sector is subject to many changes and is expected to be changed even more in the upcoming years, mainly because of the expected liberalisation of the sector. The organisations realize that the costs of personnel have to be reduced. Improved food quality helps people to eat healthy and sufficient which leads to an overall better health, and therefore less labour. Culinique could well function in the care sector because of the food quality by the end-users, the level of freedom offered to them and the limited efforts of the personnel that are required for assistance to eat. The trend in the sector, which is expected to continue is the growing interest of clients to life in a private situation instead of a central building with others. This decentralising trend asks for a meal type that can be distributed easily and preferably heated by the client itself. Delivering a chilled product sustains quality and offers to the user the freedom to eat at a convenient time for him/her. User tests with people from “Het Dorp”, a care organisation for disabled people in Arnhem, led to insight about product usage and end-user perception. Overall the product quality is appreciated and the clients would appreciate being able to use Culinique instead of the current meals. The USP’s of the product are recognised by them and are considered valuable within the organization, by clients and staff. Concerning the packaging and the containers a number of remarks are made that are taken into account during a redesign phase. Overall the user tests provide a promising result. The findings of the external studies are confirmed and point to a successful introduction for Culinique in the sector. The redesign of the containers focuses on few flaws in the current design. The most important problems of the original design are; 1. Too small dimensions to fit sufficient food 2. hot surfaces that are hard to hold and 3. difficult opening of the containers. An other requirement for re-design is enhanced brand familiarity, recognisability and exclusivity for Maître Leon. Standardization of container dimension to ease the production process and limit investments is another challenge for the design process. A new design is proposed to Maître Leon and the company owners are advised to invest in it. To conclude, a number of practical advices are provided to Maître Leon for the market introduction and further development of the product. At first the company should focus on the (health) care market, remain an open minded towards the other two investigated sectors. Teaming up with supply chain partner DeliXL mobilises a large sales team that could realise this, with little effort. The company is also advised to investigate the possibility of multi user portions in order to supply to groups of people without requiring a lot of microwave ovens. Sales price is advised to remain above the prices of competition (CuliDish and Apetito) in order to sustain a high quality image. This also supports the main overall advice to sustain the unique selling points of Culinique and prevent rapid growth that could potentially cause harm to them. A higher price matches the unique selling points and prevents too many customers in a too short period of time.","ready-to-eat meals; market explorations; (health)care market; food industry","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","strategic product design","","","",""

(mentor); Correlje, A. (mentor); Bouwmans, I. (mentor)","2010","In recent years the oil price increased to levels never seen before. This thesis attempts to identify the factors responsible for this enormous rise in prices. In this thesis the following research question is posed: ‘Can oil price movements be predicted one quarter or a year ahead, on the basis of economic factors and production and inventory levels?’ Through arguments given in literature many potential factors that might influence the oil price are identified. These factors influence the demand side of oil or the supply side. Because the identified factors are mostly qualitative in nature, proxies needed to be found for these factors. With these proxies the factors were made quantitative. With a statistical approach called ‘stepwise regression’ two models were constructed. A yearly model was formed. It turned out that the most relevant factor for movements in the oil price was the pressure of the economic development of the emerging and developing economies. Statistically, the surge in oil prices can be explained primarily through the growth of the emerging and developing economies. Because the data of the emerging and developing countries is only available on a yearly basis, another proxy was introduced for the emerging and developing economies to construct a model on a quarterly basis. The GDP of Mexico excluding oil revenues is taken as a proxy. The stepwise regression showed that on a quarterly basis the GDP of Mexico excluding oil revenues statistically accounted best, of all factors taken as input, for the oil price movements. The above leads to the conclusion that the enormous growth of the emerging and developing economies put so much pressure on the demand side, that prices rose to the never before seen levels. The models (and the underlying variables) introduced in this research, give insight in important drivers of the oil price. With this knowledge, future oil price movements might be foreseen.","oil pricing; energy markets; oil price prediction; economic factors","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","2010-08-14","Technology, Policy and Management","Economics of Infrastuctures","","Energy","",""

(mentor); Person, F.E.O.K. (mentor)","2010","Despite the fact that customers name the scent of a perfume as the number one reason for buying it, it is often very difficult for them to find a perfume they really like. Humans are poorly capable to verbally communicate scent characteristics. On top of that the perfume market is extremely large and dynamic and the offering in stores is simply too big to test. Marketers try to get customers’ attention using advertisements, and communicate olfactory characteristics trough conceptual metaphors. Although perfume packaging influences product expectations, no research on the effect of specific design elements has currently been done. This research studies the means of communication of the scent of perfume trough bottle design. A pre-study indicated that colour (hue) and shape (elongation and angularity) are design elements that customers use most often in categorization of perfume bottles. An enquiry among 450 female subjects showed that colour is by far the most important bottle design element when it comes to expectations of olfactory characteristics of perfume. Variation of hue leads to major differences in expectations of fragrance. Differences in shape influence scent expectations to a smaller extent. Additionally, bottle designs convey the same conceptual metaphors as those used in advertisements to a great extent. This indicates the relevance for product managers and marketers to create a perfume bottle that fits with both the perfumes’ scent characteristics and the metaphorical message in advertisements.","packaging design; Scent","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","2011-08-27","Industrial Design Engineering","Industrial Design","","Strategic Product Design","",""

(mentor)","2010","RNS can distribute the computation on long operands over small word-width RNS functional units able to operate in parallel. This property is the ground to develop fast arithmetic units. While RNS can boost addition and multiplication performance, other arithmetic operations like division, magnitude comparison, and sign detection are more difficult, when compared with their counterparts in the conventional binary number system. In view of that RNS is mostly utilized for special-purpose applications, e.g., digital filters, which are addition and multiplication dominated. For such applications the RNS capability to represent large numbers and the carry-free nature of arithmetic operations are of interest and can potentially enable fast and low-power arithmetic computation. The overall performance of any RNS based processor is mostly determined by the selected moduli set and the way the modular operations, i.e., addition and multiplication, are implemented in hardware (note that this two issues are intertwined). In this thesis we concentrate on the design of fast and energy effective modular adders able to compute |A + B|_m = (A + B if A + B < m, if otherwise A + B - m) as they are the fundamental building block for any RNS processor. We base our solution on a state of the art approach, i.e., ELM Modular Addition (ELMMA), which utilize anticipated computation in conjunction with fast parallel prefix addition. Our method follows the same anticipation principle but reduces the overall complexity by proposing an alternative design for the adders, which can now directly handle three inputs instead of two. In this way the initial carry-save addition required for ELMMA for the evaluation of the A+B-m is not longer required and this may potentially result in faster and more area and power effective designs. To evaluate the impact of our proposal we considered a number of moduli of practical interest as follows: 2^n - (2^{n-2} + 1), 2^n - 2^{n-2}, and 2^n - (2^{n-3}+1). For the considered moduli we implemented in VHDL two sets of implementations, i.e., one for the state of the art ELMMA and one for our proposal, for the n=16 case. We simulated, debug, and synthesized the designs using Cadence Encounter RTL Compiler for ASIC Designs for 90 nm CMOS technology. Our results indicate that for moduli 2^n - (2^{n-2} + 1), 2^n-2^{n-2}, and 2^n-(2^{n-3}+1), our proposal requires 13%, 32%, and 28% smaller area, is 14%, 3%, and 9% faster, and is 15%, 20%, and 13% more power efficient, respectively, when compared with the state of the art.","Parallel Prefix; Simplified CSA; Ambigous Carry Ripple","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Microelectronics & Computer Engineering","","Computer Engineering","",""

Sigma’s vision is to provide services, products, knowledge and skills for the protection and beautification of our sustainable environment. Sigma Coatings is high valued by the end user, the painter. The biggest competitor of Sigma, Sikkens, is higher valued at the influencers, like architects, project managers, colour consultants. Sigma’s objective is to increase brand awareness at the influencers. The strategy to reach this is to become a colour authority for these influencers. An exploratory research was executed by studying the company, the brand, the customers, the colour products and the context. To complete the exploratory study, two research projects were set up: research to the feelings and experiences of Sigma’s sales force towards colour and research to explore the feelings and experience of the influencers. Influencers are the stakeholders in construction or renovation projects. Stakeholders of eight hospital construction or renovation projects were interviewed. To complete the research stakeholders of four other projects were interviewed as well. The interviewees provided valuable insights in the colour decision making process. The interviewed sales force employees provided valuable insights about their feelings and experiences towards colour. The exploratory research showed that Sigma’s current colour message is inconsistent and incoherent. The insights in the sales force showed that colour is not implemented in the sales force employees mind and that colour is not seen as a strategic tool to improve customer relationships. The external research showed a gap in colour attention between the architect and the project manager: they both think that the other party will start talking about colour. These insights have resulted in a strategy which starts with creating a consistent, coherent colour message. The second step is to show the sales force the added value of colour so that they can use colour as a strategic tool to improve customer relationships. The sales force needs to be educated in the effects of the use of colour and the current colour tools Sigma has. To support this step, an intranet for Sigma’s sales force is introduced. The third step of the strategy focuses on the attention gap; project managers will be made aware of the effects of colours on users with the result that they will start talking about colour with their project team. The fourth step will take care of that every need for colour support will be answered by Sigma. Sigma already has a large colour product portfolio, though two products are developed to complete the portfolio in answering all the needs. Finally, when all these steps are submitted, Sigma can claim colour authority with a promotion campaign. The strategic steps are translated in practical activities, which are plotted in a roadmap. The roadmap contains 13 activities and a promotion campaign. The development of the roadmap was past the development of the overall strategic plan, including the development of three products and describing the implementation into Sigma’s organization and onto the market. The strategic plan was evaluated to identify risks and recommendations were made for the further development of the roadmap and strategy. Although the roadmap looks promising and the risks involved with the implementation appear to be low, the developed products ideally have to be tested by doing research to the reaction of the targeted customers on the products.","Colour; Authority; Strategy","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","2011-08-27","Industrial Design Engineering","PIM","","Strategic Product Design","",""

Two explorative studies using figurative against abstract visual stimuli were performed to create insight in how people experience sounds and to create a list of usable semantic associations.

A third study using mind mapping was conducted to examine what sound properties were considered as influences on a few of these categories and to optimize the categorization. The sound properties that were considered as most influential were sharpness and noisiness. The final descriptive semantic associations were placed on a scale with the axes unpleasant-pleasant and calm-active. From these the following were considered to be most usable: activated, angry, boring, calm, chaotic, cheerful, eerie, energetic, pleasant, relaxed, trustworthy and unpleasant. In a fourth study the sounds of six domestic appliances were chosen and adjusted for sharpness, noisiness and their combination. They were evaluated for their valued expression on the 12 semantic associations by 30 participants. The results showed that increased sharpness elicited a more unpleasant and activated expression and decreased sharpness elicited a more pleasant and calm expression.

(mentor); Ledoux, H. (mentor); Meijers, B.M. (mentor)","2010","Planar partitions (subdivisions of the plane into polygonal areas) constitute one of the most important data representations in GIS. They are used to model concepts as varied as land use, administrative units, natural features and cadastral parcels, among many others. However, since polygons are often stored separately, different errors and inconsistencies are introduced during their creation, manipulation (both manual and automatic) and exchange. These come in the form of invalid polygons, gaps, overlaps and disconnected polygons, which severely hampers their use in other software. Existing approaches to solve this problem usually involve polygon repair using a list of constraints, and complex planar partition repair operations performed on a planar graph. However, these have many shortcomings in terms of complexity, numerical robustness and difficulty of implementation. Moreover, they leave many invalid cases untouched. To solve this problem, a novel method to validate and automatically repair planar partitions has been developed. It uses a constrained triangulation of the polygons as a base, which being by definition a planar partition, means that only relatively simple operations are needed to ensure that the output becomes valid. Point locations are maintained throughout the process, while fully automatic repair is possible using customisable criteria. This approach is also extensible to individual polygons, is capable of handling a larger variety of cases and has good performance compared to existing alternatives; all of this with numerical robustness and maintaining topological consistency throughout. In order to analyse, test and improve the developed algorithms, and encourage further development, a fast and efficient implementation has been written in C++, which has been tested with several large data sets and compared with other available software, regarding both performance and functionality. This prototype is able to successfully repair planar partitions of more than 100,000 polygons. It is also open source and freely available on the GDMC website (http://www.gdmc.nl/).","planar partitions; polygonal coverages; topology; validation; automatic repair; simple features; constrained delaunay triangulation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2010-08-27","","GIS technology","","Geomatics","",""

One must be able to perform the simulations in a preliminary design stage, even when detailed propeller data is unavailable. From a previously performed literature study it was concluded that the actuator disk theory would be the best model to perform this study. Although FLUENT provides the FAN boundary condition (mimics an actuator disk) to model propeller induced ow, this option was discarded due to compatibility problems with the earlier FLUENT 6.3 version. Therefore a so called \actuator volume"" was created which contains only one column of cells in the axial direction. Thus instead of imposing a jump in pressure, tangential and radial velocity at the trailing edge of the propeller blade; a jump in axial, tangential and radial velocity is imposed at the cell centers of the \actuator volume"". The axial, tangential and radial velocities were imposed by loading a User Defined Function (UDF) in FLUENT. This is basically a user-written code in Cprogramming language that allows the user to create its own numerical models which can be loaded with the FLUENT solver. The equations which were used to calculate these velocities were obtained by slightly modifying the equations for an actuator disk with variable radial loading distribution as obtained by J.T. Conway. The assumptions that were made during the derivation is that one assumes steady, incompressible and inviscid ow. Outside this actuator volume the ow was calculated by using the Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes equations (RANS). The k "" model with non-equilibrium wall functions was used to model turbulent ow. To assess the performance of the UDF and the propeller model in general some validation simulations were performed. To this end a single propeller-nacelle geometry was created based on the NASA SR-1 propeller. Flow parameters such as Mach number, static pressure, etc. were extracted along three different lines of constant radius and compared with the results of a full blade modelling simulation using RANS as obtained by B. Marinus. To investigate the influence of the nacelle on the propeller another UDF was set up, which reads in the inflow velocity at the leading edge of the propeller blade. The equations of the axial, tangential and radial velocity are similar to the original UDF (uniform actuator disk), which assumes a uniform inflow velocity equal to freestream, however the freestream","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","","","","",""

We present an implementation, and show that our approach performs substantially better in terms of resource consumption than existing model checkers for GOAL. Moreover, our approach allows for more expressive property specification languages and has benefits from a software engineering point of view: the implementation of a language interpreter is gained for free. Both conceptually and on the implementation level, our approach is generic and can be applied to other agent programming languages as well. Additionally, we investigate state space reduction techniques tailored to GOAL, namely property-based slicing and partial order reduction, to further optimise our model checker's performance. To this end, we develop a static source code analysis method for GOAL agents. Case studies with both techniques show that substantial reductions can be gained when certain conditions are met.","model checking; GOAL; agents; formal verification; agent programming language","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2010-08-28","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Mediamatics","","Man-Machine Interaction Group","",""

(mentor); Pasterkamp, S. (mentor); Van der Veen, C. (mentor); Huisman, C. (mentor); Bouwmeester, J. (mentor)","2010","Structural slabs on underwater concrete are widely applied in the construction of tunnels, parking garages, rail- and road construction. Over the years many problems have been reported with aquiferous crack formation in structural slabs on underwater concrete. Aquiferous trough crack formation threatens the durability of structural slabs on underwater concrete. Through cracks can be the result of restrained deformation. Temperature- and shrinkage strains that are restrained, cause stresses in the structural slabs. Stresses from restrained deformation can cause through crack formation. During the hardening process and due to climate influences, the structural slab is affected by temperature- and shrinkage loads and cracks can form. In the design of structural slabs on underwater concrete, much attention was given to the calculation of stresses and calculation of reinforcement, but still aquiferous crack formation cannot be prevented. Over the years many discussion on the effect of an intermediate layer of sand between the structural slab and the underwater concrete has taken place amongst experts. Nowadays two sides exist; one in favour and the other against an intermediate layer of sand. Both sides are convinced that their alternative outperforms the other. No theoretical bases, but many uncertainties, exist about the magnitude of the stresses in structural slabs on underwater concrete. This research aims to create more insight in the stresses in hardened concrete that cause the forming of cracks in structural slabs on underwater concrete. The results should be used to develop a practical advice for handling of the problem of crack formation in structural slabs on underwater concrete. To obtain the goals of the research first the current state of the technology is examined in a literature study. To determine the magnitude of the stresses and to analyze the influence factors on the stresses a Finite Element model has been developed. The results of these models were used to come to a practical advice. A thermal model was built to calculate temperature loads. Based on long term temperature measurements in a structural slab on underwater concrete, the model has been calibrated. Temperature loads on any given structural slab on underwater concrete can now be calculated accurately. The temperature load in structural slabs on underwater concrete can vary between 3 °C and 17 °C. The largest influence factor on temperature load is the month of casting. The geometry of the structure can also have significant influence on the temperature load. A 3-D Finite Element structural model was designed to research the influence factors on restraint. This has gained more insight in the influence factor on the degree of restraint and the shear forces in the piles. It is now possible to calculate the degree of restraint of any structural variant of structural slabs on underwater concrete. The degree of restraint varies between 15% and 80%. The restraint is influenced to a large extent by the structural variant. The theoretical restraint can only be reduced by applying an intermediate layer of sand. With an intermediate layer of sand a possibility exists that the piles fail in shear. For practical use the complicated models have been transformed into simple calculation methods. Based on the results of the model, hand calculation methods have been developed for easy use in the building industry. Also measures to reduce stresses in the structural slab have been obtained. The efficiency of the measures is estimated by comparing the reduction of stresses to the cost of the measures. Based on the efficiency of the measures the following practical advices can be given:  Only by the application of an intermediate layer of sand a reduction in the degree of restraint can be expected  Shear forces in the piles can exceed the shear strength  The thickness of the underwater concrete should be kept as low as possible  Application of Gewi piles is an effective measure to reduce stresses in the structural slab  Sections of more than 20 meter should not be applied with an intermediate layer of sand  Extra reinforcement should not be applied as solution to the problem of crack formation  When cracks occur, injection is a relatively cheap, but not always reliable, repair method With the methods described in this research, stress calculation in structural slabs on underwater concrete can be done accurately by using FEM software. Also a quick estimation of the probability of crack formation can be made by newly developed had calculation methods. An advice is given for measures to handle crack formation. The new developments in this report have therefore clarified many uncertainties. The research increased the insight in the influence factors on crack formation in structural slabs on underwater concrete significantly and developed an easy calculation method for practical use.","underwater concrete; bouwkuip; onderwaterbeton; structural slab; constructievloer; scheurvorming; crackformation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Design and Construction","","Concrete Structures","",""

This method has been developed at the faculty of Industrial Design Engineering at Delft University of Technology. Contextmapping aims to support the obtainment of knowledge about the contextual aspects that influence the end-users experience during product use. Next to that it offer an approach to analyse the data and inform and inspire project teams with the experience knowledge obtained. During this graduation project the conventional contextmapping method has been adjusted to meet the demand within Philips. Two major adjustments have been made to the conventional contextmapping method, to make the method applicable. The first difference is that the members of a project team themselves analyse the rich experience data, instead of (end-)user researchers. Next to that an online tool has been developed to support these analysis. Next to that the tool enables the project team members to present and discuss the rich experience knowledge (obtained individually) with each other and translate this shared knowledge into concepts during a group meeting. This report can be valuable for those interested in (method like) contextmapping and the implementation (of such consumer centered methods) in a large multinational product development company.

Despite all long term investments and efforts on ACT’s, the overall effectiveness of them can vary within Dutch governmental organizations. In this research, we investigated this varying effectiveness by certain factors that have a great effect on it, mainly pronounced as implementation challenges. A literature study identified various implementation challenges which were reflecting the critical notes of authors on EA development. The resulting outcome was that most of these implementation challenges were mainly related to organizational complexity issues and dealt with the usage of EA Frameworks and Models. Therefore these aspects are investigated into more detail. In addition, three case study descriptions based on interview data were identifying new or similar implementation challenges opposed to the literature study. Each case study reflected a unique view on an ACT within a Dutch municipality. All output of this research lead to the structuring of an analytical framework, whereby feasible solution arrangements are embedded for a great part of implementation. The findings and recommendations should appeal to a broad audience including architects, business managers as well as consultants.","enterprise architecture; organizational change","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","2010-08-26","Technology, Policy and Management","Multi Actor Systems","","ICT","",""

However, organizations seeking to obtain benefits from their websites need to create and maintain websites that are successful in supporting the interaction and communication of the organization with their users. The main goal of this Thesis project was to design an improved website quality evaluation framework for academic websites from students’ perspective. For this purpose, an extensive study of the literature on existing quality evaluation models, essential website success factors and criteria was made to identify necessary quality factors, sub factors and criteria. A new and improved quality evaluation framework consisting of five high-level quality factors (Content, Usability, Reliability, Efficiency and Functionality), hierarchically arranged into sub quality factors and criteria was designed. The proposed framework was applied on a case study academic website (TU-Delft University website) to assess its effectiveness and at the same time to evaluate the quality of the website. It is observed from the results of the case study conducted to evaluate the proposed framework, that the new framework has a better construct of quality factors and sub factors as compared to the ISO 9126-1 evaluation model. However, further study should be conducted on some of the sub factors such as identity, authority, multiple language support and functionality. The results of evaluating the TU-Delft website showed that the website in general has a good quality of reliability and efficiency characteristics, while having moderate quality in its content, usability and functionality features.","academic website quality evaluation; website evaluation; website quality framework","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Computer Science/Information Architecture","","Web Information Systems","",""

Besides the efficient requirement, wide-band working frequency and compact PCB size are also attractive for cutting more cost. This thesis deals with a switch-mode Class E power amplifier which provides wide-band, highly efficient and compact size performance, with a 60W GaN HEMT device. A mathematical model for Class E amplifier is presented and analyzed. Based on the model, a novel design procedure for wide-band power amplifier design is proposed. The input/output matching networks in the amplifier are built by bondwires and pre-matching capacitors so as to give an extremely compact size. The 60W compact wide-band power amplifier is then implemented with PCB to verify the concept. A wide-band measured output power performance is observed over 1.7GHz - 2.3GHz in the range of 40-65W and the measured drain efficiency is between 66% and 74%; measured PAE is between 61% and 70%. Transducer power gain is 12dB ± 1dB over the frequency range. Besides the amplifier, additional work is about large signal device modeling with PolyHarmonic Distortion model which is based on acquiring X-parameters of a device.","power amplifier; wide-band; compact; class-E","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Microelectronics & Computer Engineering","","Microelectronics","",""

Collaborative learning is one of the essential skills for children in order to participate in the twenty-first century era. The new skills require teachers to nurture children in developing soft skills and digital literacy to participate in an information society. Therefore, children are not only needed to be prepared with the technology of the changing world, but also should acquire competence in the global landscape workforce, such as the ability to collaborate with both local and global community. Middle childhood experience a shift calls concrete operational thinking. The social developments aspects of 6 to 9 years represent the beginning of understand the importance of relationship with peer and the influence of peer group. Therefore nurturing social competence becomes an important part of the primary school education system. A field study in Delftse Montessorischool using contextmapping excercise identified that children of 6 to 9 years are aware of the meaning of friendship and have the ability to relate to both children within their immediate environment and beyond their community. The exploration study resulted in design framework, which outline the key features of social competence in collaborative learning. The concept development of the Bee together educational tool, cultivate from the design framework. Bee together educational tool aims to facilitate teacher to create a collaborative learning environment for a group of four children. The tool assists co-located peer learning and distance peer learning. The co-located peer learning nurture empathy, group idea generation and group discussion. The distance peer learning, foster active learning and exchange of learning and experience. Further experiential prototype was developed and user tested was conducted resulted in the relevance of the concept design and recommendation for further development. Three business models recommendations were generated each from its own corporate strength and the contribution to the well being of children. The business models are categories into three different approaches as education, corporate and open source. The proposed business models provides strategies from the perspective of educational organisation, commercial corporation and non profit organisation in supporting the Millennium Development Goals on enhancing primary education in terms of quality and access.","children; education tool; colaborative learning; peer learning; education","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Product Innovation Management","","Master of Science Strategic Product Design","",""

(mentor)","2010","Many stadiums are built for large tournaments like the European Championship, World Championship, and Olympic Games. These stadiums need large investments and will be used below their capacity after the tournaments. A portable stadium could avoid the vacancy and optimise the use of material and the site. In this thesis the development towards a concept design for a portable stadium is described. The concept design is made for a 30.000 seat football stadium with optimal lines of sight. The stadium can be deconstructed, transported and built within 8 months. The concept design covers the grandstand and field. The design excludes the surrounding facilities and roof. First the feasibility of a portable stadium is determined by checking the transportability of the main structural elements. Hereafter different aspects have been researched; materials, stadium seats and connections stability options. The main aspects researched influence the structure and the right to exist for a portable stadium. The right to exists can be expressed in different values: functionality, appearance, time and costs.  The quality of the lines of sight from the grandstand in relation to the structure; the slope of the grandstand, the distance to the field and the height of the grandstand all influence the lines of sight and the needed dimensions for the structure. The shape of the grandstand and the layout of the columns influence the appearance. Different functional and visual options are compared.  Possibilities of shallow foundation; the capacity of the shallow foundation depends on the depth of the foundation slab and the subsoil. In Europe the possible locations for shallow foundation for this portable stadium are limited to the 80% best subsoil.  Different structural options; the elaborated options are all based on the principles ‘direct stability’ and transportability. By folding, shifting, rotating or angling the structure, the stability is directly created during construction and the volume to transport is decreased. Different models are made to experience the portability of the structure. The concept design is based on 3 dimensional frames. Each frame consists of a girder with double hinged columns. The columns can be folded towards the girder for transportation. 52 Frames will be placed around the field. Between the frames at the top, trusses are placed. The grandstand elements (3 rows= 1 element) are placed on top of the girders and span 2 frames. Functionality: the stadium is flexible in use. Below the grandstand are large open spaces to have the flexibility to place other functions. The stadium can be adjusted for different capacities. The stadium has optimal lines of sight. Appearance: the stadium will be experienced as a fixed stadium with a spatial structure. The stadium can have a unique appearance at every location by different cladding and/ or advertisement fabrics around the stadium. Time: the time to construct, deconstruct and transport is optimised by building with relatively few elements, and by the foldability of the main structure. By unfolding and placement of the frames a direct stable structure is realized. There is no need for temporary stabilisation materials. Costs: the repeated costs are minimised by decreasing the volume to transport and simplifying the construction. The construction of the frames are standardised; all frames are constructed the same way. By the design concept the structural feasibility of a portable stadium is proven. Further research will be needed to develop the concept. The roof structure and a more detailed foundation design should be included. The concept should be further elaborated, detailed and optimised. A further financial feasibility study should be done, to prove if a portable stadium can also compete with fixed stadiums and portable grandstands from a financial point of view.","portability; stadium; direct stability; foldable structure; structural design; temporary structure; transportable","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Design and Construction","","Structural Design","",""

ICCO and FCF approached TNO to help them develop a low cost automated monitoring system to simplify and standardise the labour intensive monitoring process followed by one of their partner NGO in India. Currently the cost for periodic monitoring of small scale CDM biogas amounts to nearly 21% of the total transaction cost of the project. The insights from the research suggested that the high cost incurred in carrying out monitoring activity can be reduced by increasing end users involvement. Automation can be used to facilitate end user involvement in the data gathering and data submission phases of the monitoring process. Using technology (automation) to facilitate certain behaviour usually faces challenges against acceptance. The Fogg Behaviour Model (FBM) for persuasive design was adapted and adopted to develop a framework for the design process. The result of the design process based on the adopted framework is a strategy called ‘ICT4UP’. It is a set of 4 decision making tools, to be used by ICCO, FCF, TNO and local project proponents. The strategic decision making tool helps ICCO and FCF to select the most potential partner to implement biogas project and to support the social network based daily monitoring process plan. Further, it helps ICCO, FCF, TNO and the selected local partner to choose the most appropriate monitoring system for the context. It then guides them to design a customised technology intervention that might be needed to trigger end user involvement in the selected type of monitoring system for the context.","ICT intervention; end user participation; small scale CDM projects; biogas; monitoring process; behaviour model","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Design Engineering","","Master of Science Strategic Product Design","",""

(mentor); Mattheijssen, P. (mentor)","2010","As the first stage of the amplifier chain aiming for the base station applications, a highly linear low noise amplifier (LNA) dictates very high performance for optimum coverage with a best signal quality. In today’s commercial market, the GaAs enhancement-mode pHEMT based LNA is dominant. However, a SiGe-based LNA, due to its high integration, is still attracting the interest from industry. In this thesis, the highly linear SiGe-based LNA design procedure is presented. For the fully-differential LNA design, the base tuning and emitter tuning, which both belong to the out-of-band matching technique used to increase linearity, are analyzed in details. Although the base tuning suffers more from mismatches in comparison with the emitter tuning, it is proved that proper choice of the harmonic trap capacitor is able to mitigate this effect, which can trigger a higher linearity. For the single-ended LNA design, the out-of-band matching is still feasible for narrow band applications. A compact topology of highly linear low noise amplifier which is composed of an emitter inductive degeneration and out-of-band matching core is proposed. Moreover, a modified neutralization function block based on on-chip transformer and bondwire inductor is also proposed. For this configuration, simultaneous noise/input matching, linearity improvement and a good reverse isolation is able to be achieved. It proved effective and convenient for a packaged monolithic RF chip. However, most input-referred linearity optimization techniques focused on the harmonic termination design at the input part, which leads to a narrower bandwidth and a higher noise figure due to extra losses in practice. To avoid these issues, an innovative linearity improvement method based on optimizing the output load is proposed. A novel two-stage highly linear LNA is designed to validate this theory. It achieved a power gain of 29dB and noise figure of 0.7dB at 1.7GHz, while only consumed 41mA from 3.3V supply. The OIP3 can be better than 38dBm from 1.2GHz to 2GHz. The input-referred 1dB compression point is -5dBm. The simulated result is the state-of-the-art among the current existing SiGe-based LNAs for base station applications. The design, as a part of a highly linear monolithic RF receiver, has been carried out using NXP QUBiC4x BiCMOS technology.","LNA; base station; high linearity","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2011-08-27","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Microelectronics & Computer Engineering","","","",""

Earlier studies have demonstrated that large volumes of gas can be produced from gas hydrate accumulations by means of depressurization-induced dissociation using vertical wells. In this study gas hydrate production from a class-3-hydrate reservoir is investigated, on how the production results change if a homogeneous or a heterogeneous reservoir is used for the simulations. The production is by means of a vertical well drilled at the edge of the reservoir. Additionally, it has been studied how the placement of a vertical well and the number of vertical wells and their spacing influences the production. Also the efficiency of producing from a single horizontal well is studied and compared to the results of simulations with vertical wells. It was observed that the permeability of the reservoir has a strong impact on how the methane hydrates dissociate in the reservoir. Comparing the production data and how the reservoir has been swept of gas hydrates for the different scenarios employing various kind and amounts of well, it can be concluded that the scenario with two vertical wells is the most efficient scenario studied giving the most efficient production, low water production also because unwanted gravity segregation could be avoided.","gas hydrates; gas production; multiple wells; horizontal wells","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Petroleum Engineering and Geosciences","","Petroleum Engineering and Geosciences","",""

(mentor)","2010","Het Erasmus MC ziet de patiënt mondiger worden en heeft besloten de kansen van informatie technologie in te zetten om de patiënt meer te betrekken bij het zorgproces. In deze scriptie wordt ingegaan op een architectuur voor het over de grenzen van de organisatie heen delen en verzamelen van patiënt informatie om zo beter geïnformeerd te zijn en de patiënt beter van dienst te kunnen zijn. Veel ziekenhuizen kiezen daarbij voor een oplossing die alleen voor hen werkt, Erasmus MC daarentegen ziet gelijk kansen om ook tussen zorgverleners data uit te kunnen wisselen. In deze context is voor een patiëntenportal / zorgverlenerportaal framework aanpak gekozen waarbij diverse reeds bestaande (commerciële) softwarediensten kunnen worden. In deze context is het doel van dit onderzoek een architectuur voor het integreren van autonome diensten op een regionaal patiëntenportal te ontwerpen. Het ontwerp gaat volgens een Design Science proces waarbij via een ontwikkel – evaluatie cycle het ontwerp wordt verfijnd, rekening houdend met omgevingsfactoren en literatuur. Onder omgevingsfactoren vallen ook een groot aantal interviews en reviewsessies met betrokkenen en experts. Het integreren van online autonome software diensten is meestal een dure aangelegenheid wanneer achteraf twee of meer systemen aan elkaar gekoppeld moeten worden. Door een generieke oplossing te formuleren en deze te communiceren aan de betrokken partijen is dit te voorkomen. Deze generieke oplossing, de architectuur, moet niet alleen op papier een logisch verhaal zijn maar moet ook rekening houden met de complexe en veranderende omgeving waarin het zich begeeft. De architectuur overstijgt de verantwoordelijkheid van één partij en moet rekening houden met vele belangen zoals, voorkeuren, politiek, contracten, bestaande software, technology push en standaarden adoptie. Vanuit dit opzicht wordt architectuur vanuit een socio-technisch perspectief benaderd. De architectuur bestaat uit de volgende technologische componenten. Het patiëntenportal / zorgverlenerportaal framework vormt het basis applicatieplatform waarop autonome softwarediensten kunnen worden geplaatst. Deze diensten kunnen applicatielogica aanbieden en data gebruiken. Bij het gebruik van data is een referentie naar een zorginformatiemodel mogelijk. Dit framework kan weer worden ingeladen in bestaande Ziekenhuis Informatie Systemen. Naast het identificeren van de technologische componenten is een architectuur van de informatie uitwisseling uitgewerkt. Dit begint met 1-richting verkeer: het presenteren van een kern dossier in de regio. Door gebruik te maken van een beperkte set informatie op basis van de CCR (Continuity of Care Record) en deze te koppelen aan bestaande informatie elementen (zoals de ontslagbrief en de medicijnkaart) ontstaat een set afspraken over welke informatie op welke wijze gedeeld kan worden in de regio. Uit politiek oogpunt kan in de regio Rijnmond beter worden gesproken over de CCD (Continuity of Care Document), een als HL7 verpakt CCR, in verband met een eerdere afwijzing van de CCR in de regio. Zodra zorginformatie wordt gedeeld met andere zorgverleners en deze hebben geen vast samenwerkingsverband is het belangrijk dat er afspraken zijn over wat de vastgelegde informatie (zoals een bloeddrukmeting) exact betekent. Dit kan bereikt worden door een centrale zorginformatiemodellendatabase op te nemen als onderdeel van de architectuur zodat er altijd een referentie is naar de context van de informatie. Zorginformatiemodellen kunnen gemodelleerd zijn met behulp van OpenEHR (in de vorm templates met referenties naar archetypen) of met behulp van HL7 (in de vorm van een templates met referenties naar het RIM) en zijn opgebouwd volgens richtlijnen van de beroepsgroep (bv. NHG standaarden). Voor 2-richting verkeer is een typische vragenlijst een goed voorbeeld zoals bleek uit een review van de betrokken artsen. Vragenlijsten of formulieren zijn de basis van informatievergaring. Hierbij voegt een patiënt informatie toe aan zijn dossier. Ook hier is een referentie naar een zorginformatiemodel van belang wanneer de data ook transmuraal waarde wil houden. Voor intern gebruik is dit niet noodzakelijk. Om autonome diensten (kan zowel 1-richting, 2-richting, of synchrone dienst zijn) te kunnen laden in de portal is onderzocht welke technieken hiervoor geschikt zouden kunnen zijn. Deze technieken vallen onder de noemer “remote interactie”. Dit is een set technieken die nog maar mondjesmaat in de business worden gebruikt maar wel veel mogelijkheden bieden in deze web 2.0 setting. Er zijn een tweetal technieken geselecteerd die voldoen aan de eisen: WSRPv2 en AJAX via proxy. Om een dergelijke remote interactie echter mogelijk te maken is het nodig afspraken te maken over: authenticatie, autorisatie, consent en patiënt context. Dit zijn generieke services die elke dienst moet implementeren wil het binnen de portal geladen kunnen worden. Hiervoor stellen we voor een Health API te ontwikkelen die deze services definieert. De ontwikkelde generieke architectuur is getest door het doorlopen van een typische case. Deze laat zien dat de architectuur geschikt is, maar wel additionele services toegevoegd moeten worden voor de projectarchitectuur welke implementeerbaar is. We bevelen aan om de architectuur breder te toetsen, indien nodig te verbeteren en te implementeren. Architectuur kan in een socio-technisch kader gezien worden. Het ontwikkelen van een architectuur is arbeidsintensief doordat vele stakeholders betrokken zijn. Implementatie kan eerst middels een prototype gaan om daarmee draagvlak te creëren en de stakeholders er bij te betrekken. Acceptatie is een proces dat tijd en inspanning nodig heeft. Inleven in de incentives tot participatie en blokkeermacht. Dit is cruciaal omdat dit een valkuil kan zijn welke succes in de weg staat. Met een geschikte architectuur kan Erasmus MC 2 problemen tegelijk oplossen: transmurale communicatie opzetten en vereenvoudiging van de interne complexe IT.","patiëntenportal; zorgverlenerportaal; zorginformatiemodel; remote interactie; transmuraal","nl","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Technology, Policy and Management","ICT","","Technische Bestuurskunde","",""

(mentor)","2010","This thesis reports on the design and modeling of decoupled and tunable bandwidth MEMS vibratory gyroscopes that were designed for the medical applications of tremor compensation and micro-surgical tool navigation. Two different designs are presented. The first design is a dual mass de-coupled gyroscope that consists of a drive and sense mass implemented in a drive frame architecture. The device achieves a theoretical maximum resolution of 0.01 deg/s and a maximum sensitivity of 5.247 F/deg/s. However, this design is prone to quadrature error that drastically reduces the sensitivity of the device and completely destroys its performance. The second design is a three-mass doubly-decoupled gyroscope that consists of a drive, Coriolis and sense mass and is designed to overcome the sensitivity of the dual mass de-coupled gyroscope to quadrature error. The three-frame structure of this gyroscope, with an outer sensing frame, leads to an improved electrical sensitivity over conventional architectures. It leads to a full decoupling between the sense and drive modes that makes the device robust against quadrature error and eliminates the cross axis sensitivity that usually limits the angular rate sensing performance. The device achieves a theoretical maximum resolution of 0.006 deg/s and a maximum sensitivity of 1.255 F/deg/s. Optimizing this design based on the DVA principle leads to a 60 % reduction in the size of the Coriolis mass, resulting in a 37 % increase in the resolution and an 19 % increase in the sensitivity. The drive and sense mode resonance frequencies of the designs are 2500 Hz and 2830 Hz respectively, with an input angular rate bandwidth tunable between 40Hz and 330Hz. Both COMSOL finite element simulations and macro models implemented in Agilent ADS were used to validate the structures.","Inertial Sensors","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2014-12-01","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Microelectronics","","Electronic Instrumentation","",""

The bandwidth limitation of Class-B Power amplifier is generally caused by the narrow band 2nd harmonic short. In this thesis the methods of 2nd harmonic manipulation in Class-B power amplifier are discussed. In the beginning, the current and voltage waveforms at output of the amplifier are analyzed, and a series of load configurations which can give good performance in Class-B power amplifier is given. In single-ended topology the traditional 2nd harmonic short networks are band limited and interaction between fundamental impedance and 2nd harmonic impedance limited the performance of short networks. Introducing varactors into the short networks the bandwidth of amplifier is extended. Performance of commercial varactor is restricted by the breakdown voltage and package parasitic. A 32% relative bandwidth Class-B power amplifier is realized with the 90 V break down voltage varactors from the Aeroflex central frequency of the amplifier is 1 GHz, the drain efficiency is above 65% over the frequency band. In differential topology the fundamental signal and 2nd harmonic are isolated, which provides convenience for wideband design. In practical design the bandwidth limitation is generally caused by the non-idea transformer in fundamental matching, compensation capacitors are required at primary of transformer. In low power condition, the 2nd harmonic short bandwidth can be extended by using the coupling between primary inductors. Two loops structure is applied in this case. In high power design, the 2nd harmonic is shorted though the large compensation capacitors. One loop structure is applied in this condition. In simulation result these structures can provide 50% to 70% relative bandwidth, which indicates their potential in wideband Class-B design.","Power amplifier; Class B; wideband","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2010-09-06","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Microelectronics & Computer Engineering","","Microwave group","",""

Due to confidential information or other reasons only a part of the publication is presented in the repository. Doherty Power Amplifier (DPA) is employed to improve the efficiency when operated with complex modulated signals. Due to its simplicity and high efficiency performance, it has become the preferred choice of industry. However, practical implementations of DPA only provide limited RF bandwidth, especially at high power level. The traditional narrow band device matching network, required phase shift for proper load modulation and impedance inverter seriously limit the bandwidth of DPA. In this work, the frequency behavior of the ideal 2-way symmetrical DPA is analyzed in detail, followed by the introduction of two new impedance inverters used to improve the bandwidth of DPA. In order to fully exploit the wideband potential of the new impedance inverters, the phase relation between the main and peak amplifier should be adjusted according to the power level at every frequency, which can be stored in a lookup table. Based on a previous wideband 20W DPA with mixed-signal input drive, in which the device output capacitance is incorporated into the impedance inverter, a modified DPA using the idea of compensated impedance inverter is designed and simulated. The prototype DPA design is implemented with NXP LDMOS bare die device. Simulation results have shown more than 50% 6dB back off efficiency from 1.5GHz to 2.2GHz, compared with the original case whose 50% efficiency bandwidth is from 1.9GHz to 2.3GHz. Since the prototype DPA is implemented at a low power level with bare die devices and mixed-signal input drive, it cannot be used for the practical base station applications. Traditional high power discrete DPA design method is introduced and the frequency behavior is analyzed. It is found that for the high power DPA, the matching network and the offset line are more important than the impedance inverter for the narrow bandwidth of DPA. A new DPA structure was proposed for wideband operation. Simulation results show smaller gain and power added efficiency spread in a 200MHz frequency band from 2.04GHz to 2.24GHz than the traditional DPA.","Doherty power amplifier; impedance inverter; wideband","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2010-08-27","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Microelectronics & Computer Engineering","","Microwave group","",""

The smart load control devices are applied to avoid the fluctuating unsteady aerodynamic loads. In the context of alleviating these loads, the unsteady behaviour of the flow over a DU96W180 airfoil model due to the oscillation of a 0.2c flap is investigated. By building a database of unsteady flow experiments, reference material is created for the validation of Computational Fluid Dynamics models simulating unsteady conditions.

(mentor)","2010","The area of New Orleans was hit by Hurricane Katrina in August 2005. A large part of the city got flooded due to bad design, construction and maintenance of the levee system. In order to increase the level of protection of the city, the levees are heightened and strengthened in the framework of the Hurricane and Storm Damage and Risk Reduction System (HSDRRS). On the long term the restoration of coastal wetlands is also part of the program. Since the 1930’s wetland erosion in coastal Louisiana has been recorded. The main cause of the erosion is the canalization of the Mississippi River, land subsidence and sea level rise, and salt water intrusion by alteration of drainage patterns. One way of initiating wetland restoration is the construction of diversions. The Violet Diversion is the largest diversion planned in the Pontchartrain Basin. Water from the Mississippi River is diverted into Lake Borgne and the Biloxi marsh in order to decrease salinities in those target areas. In order to get more insight in the impact of the diversion on salinity (gradients), hydrodynamic and salinity modeling of the Pontchartrain Basin is desired. Due to lack of data and time, model calibration on salinity was not accomplished. The goal of this study is to model a dynamic equilibrium of yearly averaged salinity in the Pontchartrain Basin. The lessons learned from this study can be a start for subsequent modeling efforts of the Violet Diversion. In Delft3D-FLOW a grid was set-up to model tidal propagation in Lake Borgne. The grid consists of a little less than 53,000 nodes. The initial bathymetry and roughness are taken from the ADCIRC SL15 model. The model is forced with the amplitudes and phases of the ten most important tidal constituents. In order to calibrate the model, the tidal channels are enlarged and the bottom friction is decreased. The necessity of these changes was already proven by the application of the harmonic method on the Pontchartrain Basin, as well as the moderate results of previous model studies. The model is calibrated on tidal amplitudes (accuracy within 10%) and fluxes through the tidal passes (accuracy within 1%). Phases were considered less important. Salinity was implemented by simulating initial salinities and river discharges on top of the tide. Comparing 2D with 3D simulations, gravitational circulation occurs in the 3D modeling. This causes an increased salt water intrusion from the Gulf of Mexico towards Lake Borgne and the Biloxi Marsh. However, the salinities in this target area are too low in the dynamic equilibrium situation. This is explained by the underestimation of transport by tides and Mississippi River discharge towards Lake Borgne. Previous model studies proved that circulation around the continental shelf cannot be neglected for tidal transport. Also, the Mississippi River discharge can flow around the Birdfoot. Due to the choice of the model domain, that flow cannot occur in this study. Using the tide-calibrated model for salinity studies, it is recommended to model in 3D to simulate the gravitational circulation. Nontidal water level elevations and currents should be included in the boundary conditions. This can be achieved by enhancing the model domain to capture a larger part of the Gulf of Mexico and the Mississippi Birdfoot. Then the flow around the Birdfoot can also be simulated. Wind should also be added to the hydrodynamic simulations. The measured salinities and the target salinities show seasonal variation. Therefore future modeling should strive for real-time simulation by forcing the model with time-series. The diversion flow can then be varied per month or season.","Pontchartrain Basin; salinity modeling; Lake Borgne; tidal propagation; Delft3D","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","","",""

(mentor); Roscam Abbing, E. (mentor)","2010","In Holland Casino (HC) neemt de omzet welke behaald wordt met de eet- en drinkmogelijkheden (F&B) af. Gasten bestellen minder vaak iets te eten of drinken terwijl ze aan het spelen zijn binnen de verschillende vestigingen van HC. Om gasten weer meer te laten eten en drinken, en hierdoor de F&B omzet te laten toenemen, is er gedurende dit afstudeerproject een cross-selling strategie geformuleerd tussen de F&B mogelijkheden van HC en de verschillende speelmogelijkheden. HC heeft de enige vergunning voor een casino in Nederland, hierdoor heeft HC als enige toestemming van de Nederlandse overheid om tafel spelen te exploiteren wat zorgt voor een uniek aanbod van spel en speelsheid. En wat ervoor zorgt dat HC afhankelijk is van de Nederlandse overheid. Per 1 April 2010 heeft HC zijn huisstijl aangepast, hiermee is er begonnen aan de modernisering van huidige producten en diensten met een duidelijke focus op de gast. Geografisch gezien over Nederland wordt er door HC geen goed bereikbaar gelegaliseerd gokken aangeboden. Er wordt door HC benadrukt dat ze niet op winstmaximalisatie uit zijn, echter hebben ze wel als strategisch doelstelling gesteld om te opereren met een optimaal rendement. Er komen met de modernisering van HC meer doelgroepen in aanmerking voor een bezoek aan HC, en de sterkte van het merk neemt onder ex-bezoekers toe waardoor het weer interessant wordt voor hun om HC te bezoeken. Ondanks dit feit neemt het aantal gasten van HC af, mogelijk omdat consumenten steeds meer individualistisch worden en er in de Nederlandse cultuur een toenemende trend is om geld te besparen. Internationaal gezien hebben grote casino ketens andere richtlijnen. Deze richtlijnen mogen ze zelf opstellen waardoor ze in het voordeel zijn. Met behulp van deze feiten kunnen de volgende zoekvelden gevormd worden:  Het moderniseren van HC met stijlvolle en betrouwbare concepten om F&B cross-selling te verbeteren.  Het beter voorzien van F&B mogelijkheden aan gasten,en gastgericht te werk gaan bij het creëren van deze mogelijkheden  Moderne F&B mogelijkheden creëren.  Het aanbod van games uitbreiden met een winstgevend, speels concept wat F&B (cross-) verkoopt.  Een uniek aanbod in F&B mogelijkheden creëren die de bedrijfswinst vergroot. Om deze zoekvelden te toetsen aan de praktijk zijn er observaties gehouden in verschillende vestigingen van HC, en is er gebenchmarkt in verschillende vergelijkbare industrieën. De zoekvelden worden tastbaar met behulp van raakvlakken met gasten van HC. Deze raakvlakken geven dus weer hoe gasten van HC naar aanleiding van het observatie onderzoek met de zoekvelden in aanraking kunnen komen:  De plaatsing van een concept in het SPA gebied.  Het visueel aantrekkelijk zijn.  Het gebruik van het concept met een ‘medium energy level’.  Het mogelijk maken van cross-selling op een speelse en winstgevende manier.  De timing van de verkoop van het juiste product aan de juiste gast. Hierbij is er voor het SPA gebied gekozen omdat gasten in dit gebied overduidelijk minder vaak iets te eten of drinken bestellen terwijl ze aan het spelen zijn. Het grootste aantal bezoekers van HC is afkomstig uit dit gebied. Terwijl uit dit kwalitatieve onderzoek is gebleken dat deze gasten het minst mobiel zijn. Ze zijn erg gericht op hun spel, en hebben hierdoor geen tijd om F&B te bestellen. Om hierop in te spelen zal er dus gedurende de rest van het afstudeerproject hierop gericht worden. Het energy level is bepaald aan de hand van overeenkomende indrukken tussen de benchmark studies en de observaties. Als het druk is en er is veel interactie, bijvoorbeeld bij de vulstations bij IKEA of aan de speeltafels (TAF) in HC, dan is er een hoog energy level. Als het rustig is en er is niet veel interactie, zoals de wachtruimtes in de Schiphol lounge of het restaurant gebied van HC, dan is er een laag energy level. Een medium energy level ligt daar tussen in. Er is voor gekozen omdat het concept te maken zal hebben met de rust van het spelen, en de drukte van iets te eten halen terwijl je aan het spelen bent op een machine. Hierdoor zal het concept in beide gevallen toegankelijk moeten zijn, en zal het concept dus met een ‘medium energy level’ gebruikt moeten kunnen worden. De zoekvelden en de raakvlakken leiden tot een ‘mission statement’: Wij streven ernaar om een nieuw concept te ontwikkelen dat F&B combineert met de speelsheid van een bezoek aan Holland Casino. Dit concept is stijlvol, uniek, visueel aantrekkelijk en gemakkelijk bereikbaar. Het (cross-) verkoopt F&B op een winstgevende en speelse manier door het aanbieden van het juiste F&B-product, aan de juiste persoon, op het juiste moment. Nu de scope van dit project verkleind is en de probleemstelling scherper, is het duidelijk wat men wil weten van consumenten, en met wie men wil praten. Namelijk wat de F&B behoeftes zijn in het SPA gebied, van SPA gebied bezoekers, welke voornamelijk uit vaste gasten en uitgaanders bestaan. Om deze reden is er een kwalitatief onderzoek in de praktijk gehouden met behulp van face-to-face interviews. Hieruit volgt dat: Alle F&B behoeftes van consumenten in het SPA gebied van HC hebben de service van personeel in dit gebied als basis. Er zal een betere toegang mogelijk moeten zijn voor het oproepen van deze service aan een machine. Nu er vanuit de praktijk duidelijk is geworden waaraan het concept moet voldoen is er naar ideeën gekeken welke naar aanleiding van verschillende brainstorms zijn opgesteld. Hieruit kwam naar voren dat het programma waarmee men F&B besteld terwijl men achter een spelmachine zit te spelen eigenlijk de basis was voor een nader te definiëren concept, en dus eigenlijk de strategie om F&B te cross-sellen volgens dit afstudeerproject het beste representeert. Het programma waarmee men F&B kan bestellen is een medium waarmee men de toegang tot service aan de gokkast vergemakkelijkt. Daarom kan het een ‘service’ programma genoemd worden wat de communicatie tussen mens en machine vergemakkelijkt. Een dergelijk programma wordt ook wel een interface genoemd, en daarom kan dit programma een service interface genoemd worden. Het zet informatie van het ene systeem (de mens) om in begrijpelijke en herkenbare informatie van een ander systeem (de software waarmee men F&B besteld). Na de interface meer gedetailleerd te hebben is er een implementatieplan voor HC over geschreven.","cross-selling; Food & Beverage; Service Interface","nl","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","2011-08-25","Industrial Design Engineering","Industrial Design","","Master of Science Strategic Product Design","",""

Designers are familiar with the creative process but users are not. The heuristic tasks given to users should reveal their creativity and harness it for high-quality outcomes.

Children are taking part in these processes and their involvement requires an understanding about their needs and abilities. Contextmapping with children has many aspects yet to be discovered, one of which is harnessing children’s creativity during generative sessions. This forms the basis for this research. The thesis traces an overview of creativity, co-design with children, contextmapping with children and children’s creativity. The literature review opens a new area for investigation about using competition, which is seen both detrimental and challenging for eliciting creativity from children, as a motivation during contextmapping activities. The empirical study is formed from six sessions aiming to find an answer to the effects of cooperation and competition on children’s creativity during contextmapping sessions in regard to gender differences. The analyzed and discussed findings show that competition is a motivating element and has positive impacts on children’s creativity, it increases children’s motivation towards contextmapping tasks and the outcomes of the sessions are more appropriate to the expectations of the task.","creativity; co-design; designing with children; contextmapping","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Industrial Design","","Master of Science Design for Interaction","",""

(mentor); Wever, R. (mentor); De Witte, A. (mentor)","2010","Recently a new powder product in the Medical Nutrition range has been developed for elderly to prevent sarcopenia, within Danone known as Spartacus. Sarcopenia is the loss of muscle mass and strength, resulting in immobility and frailty. Current packaging formats might cause usability problems with elderly; therefore a new format has to be designed. The product will be launched as Fortifit under the sub brand Nutricia Advanced Medical Nutrition. Medical nutrition has more stakeholders than fast moving consumer goods: since most of the products are reimbursed, insurance companies and health care authorities are also involved. There are only three main competitors: Nestlé, Fresenius Kabi and Abbott. These all have similar products and packaging formats in their portfolio. The Spartacus project is currently in the clinical trial phase: the composition of the powder has been defined and tasting sessions have been done, and research with elderly now has to show that the product is actually working. Fortifit will however be put on the market before the trial is finished, because competitor Nestlé has recently put a similar product on the market. The powder contains proteins, vitamin D and amino acids, that all help to rebuild muscle fiber, and calcium for bone health. The product is targeted on pre-frail up to frail elderly that are still living independently, something from which sarcopenia might prevent them. The causes of sarcopenia have been researched, as well as other characteristics from elderly, such as ergonomics or the problems they have with different types of packaging formats. The external environment of packaging and medical nutrition has also been analyzed: packaging of other products, trends, patents and law and guidelines. To find out which usability problems occur with the current packaging formats and preparation methods a usability test with elderly has been done. Packaging formats that were tested were can and sachet, both used for medical nutrition, and the eazypack, currently used for baby nutrition, and preparation methods stirring and shaking, of which the latter is also used in the clinical trial. The test focused on three aspects that are involved: opening, dosing and preparation. A lot of problems concerning opening occurred with the eazypack: it was not clear how to open it. Cans and sachets scored better, and also required less force for opening. According to elderly, dosing with a sachet is easier than with a scoop (in cans or eazypacks). Unlike what was expected earlier, shaking turned out to be a comfortable preparation method for elderly. Another advantage is that the product dissolves better using the shaker. The usability test and the analysis resulted in a list of requirements for the development of a “starter kit”: a box with a shaker and four sachets. The design process started with a morphological chart, in which the design was split up into several small aspects for which sketches were made, such as “how can you make something easy to hold?” or “how can you pack a single serve dose?” These sketches lead, in a series of diverging and converging paths, to two concepts for a shaker and three for a single serve sachet. These concepts were tested in a second usability test, to make sure the most user-friendly solution was chosen. Elderly were asked which design they preferred and for what reason. The chosen concepts were optimized on several aspects: usability problems found in the test were solved; dimensions and sealing methods were optimized with the influence of discussions with colleagues, practical tests and the development of the secondary packaging. This resulted in the final design, consisting out of a primary packaging, a shaker and a secondary packaging. The primary packaging is an oblong sachet that is sealed on three sides. The side seal has a precut, indicating where to start tearing. It is made out of printed a paper-PE-aluminium-PE laminate, which is easy to tear. The shaker consists out of three parts: a cup, a cap and a sieve. The cup, which is made out of injection blowmolded PP, a BPA-free plastic that is clear, dishwasher-safe and resistant to aromas, has an indent, that makes is comfortable to hold. It has screw thread on the inside (the cap has it on the outside) so that it is comfortable to drink directly from the shaker. The sieve, which is made out of injection molded SBC, a thermoplastic elastomer, can be inserted in the cap. Since it is clamped in the cap, it is automatically removed when screwing off the cap. The secondary packaging consists out of one shaker and four sachets. It is a printed paperboard box with a separation between the shaker and the sachets and a flip-top cap. It is packed with 10 in a tertiary box of 30x40, which is collomodular and can therefore be palletized very efficiently. Before the packaging concept can be put on the market more development steps are required. Suppliers have to be found for all packaging materials, as well as an external producer with an injection molding and blow molding machine for the shaker. Shelf life tests have to prove the paper laminate has enough barriers to protect the product for a certain period. Pallet tests have to be done to make sure the secondary packaging survives transportation all over the world. A more detailed cost calculation has to be done, to define investment and packaging costs more accurately. Overall, the design combines functionality, user-friendliness and a low cost price. It complies with the wishes and demands that were developed after extensive analysis of the product, the target group and the context.","medical nutrition; packaging; user research","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","2011-08-25","Industrial Design Engineering","Design Engineering","","Master of Science Design for Interaction","",""

(mentor); Kopecka, J. (mentor)","2010","Festo is a leading world-wide supplier of automation technology and in this sector also the performance leader in industrial training and education programs. The dutch regional office of Festo has in the past decade experienced a change in their relationships with customers. Not only has their market changed from a technology push to a technology pull market, but are customers nowadays looking for partners that are able to deliver integrated functional solutions to their automation problems. Festo NL is a company driven by innovation and in many senses ahead of the competition, but problems occur when attempting to introduce disruptive technology. Disruptive innovations come hand in hand with high market uncertainty, and require inventive and highly customisable applications to be materialised. Finding the necessary markets is a demanding task, in which Festo NL is limited by their traditional business culture. Also, Festo NL has troubles satisfying the demands of customers, simply because the products do not offer what the engineers are used to. Disappointing launches of disruptive innovations have made Festo NL realise their innovation approach in these cases are not optimal. The source of the problems identified is the increasing importance of information value-adding activities in current business environments. It is changing the way companies, such as Festo NL, need to perform business, and asks for more efficient use of information and knowledge from supply chain partners. Linear and traditional innovation models, as fostered by Festo NL, focus on physical value adding activities and limits them in their attempts to provide customers with good solutions to their automation problems. Successful commercialising of products in this modern business environment asks for drastic measures. To tackle these issues companies need to embrace Open Innovation business models and leave linear and traditional innovation models behind. By allowing for external as well as internal sources of information to enter the company, Festo NL is able to extend their reach. Open Innovation models ask for a social and flexible way of communicating with customers. The goal should be to engage in an intrinsic dialogue with lead-users, and at the same time stimulate experimental and conceptual design of new applications. By doing that Festo NL can deliver more customer centred products, and deliver more value to new markets. The main means of such a dialogue is profound information and knowledge sharing between people, which is catalysed by Social Media communication. Social Media communication tools facilitate the necessary information and knowledge sharing, and at the same time offers interactive tools which stimulate collaboration and exploration of new ideas, which can lead to new applications. By implementing an online platform based on Social Media communication activities, Festo NL can extend their reach and deliver products and services that add value for their customers. ‘Seed’ is a concept of community which will help Festo NL towards embracing Social Media communication and Open Innovation. Festo NL will by implementing such a community become more customer centred and at the same time find new markets for disruptive innovations. Developers of disruptive innovations at Festo will profit from this increased reach and ability to create customised products, making Festo NL more innovative and able to stay ahead of the competition.","Disruptive Innovation; Customer Market; Open Innovation; Social Media","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Product Innovation Management","","Master of Science Strategic Product Design","",""

Famous examples include Google’s GMail, Maps and Docs, as well as Twitter and Facebook. These technological advancements bring along a number of challenges, mostly concerning web application testing. In this thesis, we propose a number of techniques to automatically test web applications using invariants on the application’s Document Object Model (DOM) and invariants on the application’s JavaScript code. Using a proxy, we add JavaScript source code that can generate an execution trace. This trace contains all information about the JavaScript variables that is needed to derive invariants on them. Next, we crawl the web application. This can be done manually or in an automated fashion. Crawling the application will generate the actual execution trace. The invariants can be derived using special tools that analyze the trace. Furthermore, during crawling, the DOMs of the web application are fed to an algorithm that can derive invariants on the DOM. We implemented all this as plugins to Crawljax, however these techniques are not only appliable to Crawljax. To evaluate the quality of the invariants, we conducted several case studies. The results are encouraging, meaning our work can be used to automatically generate invariants which can be used for regression testing of dynamic web applications.","invariants; web applications; javascript; dom; automated","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Softwaretechnologie","","Software Engineering","",""

(mentor); Diehl, J.C. (mentor)","2010","The original goal of this project is to design a win-win solution: boosting Chinese growers’ businesses, by matching their needs with Dutch know-how, then naturally establishing potential market in China for Dutch horticulture technology companies, for instance, Codema. After early research and 2-month field research, the researcher discovered that driven by the increasing consumer demands, the horticulture chain in China is growing at a tremendous speed. And at the very beginning of the chain, Chinese growers could be classified into 3 groups: beginner, senior and expert based on their production equipments: plastic tunnels, sunlight greenhouses, and gutter-connected greenhouse. The application of gutter-connected greenhouse concentrated on breeder in both vegetable and flower industry. Different growers have different needs in terms of technology. Top tier growers focus on the quality, quantity and controlling the cost by means of chain integration. They need unique seeds, alternative to high labor cost, efficient logistics, and trustworthy marketing means like organic labeling. Senior growers at middle level started to scale up their production and become aware of the importance of quality. They need affordable heating solution and means to improve sales. Novice peasants intend to minimize cost as much as possible. They ask for cheaper solution during the initial investment and more upgrade options based on sunlight greenhouse. Based on these various needs from different growers, 3 different approaches, introduction customization and modularization, have been suggested. For these 3 different approaches, the basic knowledge of running horticultural business is fundamental. It’s the perfect language to communicate with senior and expert growers during introduction and customization. It could also support the Beginner growers to level up To get a thorough understanding of what this knowledge is, the researcher visited several successful Chinese and Dutch growers, and integrated their inputs and formulated a generic method of planning a horticulture business: start with the initial capital, plant type, and production location; aim at economic profit; deduce the plant price, quality and yield; and then discover the ideal production parameters (light, water, nutrition, etc); and finally decide the plan of investing various resources (labor, land, energy, equipment, etc) based on their contributions to the total profit. And this method was later embodied into a greenhouse investment tool to: a, educate the novice peasant grower about how to start a horticulture business; b, optimize senior grower’s investment plan; c, fully configure through the whole chain for expert grower. It also benefits Dutch partners in 2 ways. In the short term, the business value of Dutch technology becomes more visible and understandable to potential Chinese client. In the long run, it increases the knowledge inside Dutch horticulture sector about various needs of Chinese growers for future development. A prototype was built and tested by Chinese senior grower with quite positive feedback. Multiple stakeholders from the Netherlands and China are reacting positively and willing to push this project forward to the next stage.","China; Chinese; Growers; greenhouse; Dutch; horticulture; investment","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","2011-08-25","Industrial Design Engineering","Design Engineering","","Master of Science Design for Interaction","",""

(mentor); Kopecka, J.A. (mentor)","2010","Stud anchors represent a mature and saturated market segment characterized by tough competition and highly optimized production, in a market environment that is heavily driven by approvals and safety regulations. Internal analysis has shown the latent need in specific markets and applications for feedback to the customer during and after the setting process about the correct setting of the anchor. The exact customer demand was unclear, but a product feature setting control has the potential to increase differentiation. This latent need was picked up by the Application Driven Development group in the mechanical anchor development department. Within this thesis the “Application driven development” methodology was analyzed through comparison to a variety of other modern value oriented development approaches. The identified points where combined into a process approach that was optimized for reaching the target of the project, which was: ‘Optimizing the Application Driven Development approach to develop a setting control for the Hilti stud anchors and to formulate a strategy for market introduction’ To fulfill this target, the focus was on these three issues: - Establishing technical feasibility for a setting control for stud anchors, that provides: (1)A clear feedback when setting the stud anchor that it has been set correctly. (2) An ‘inspectability’ of the anchor after it has been set, to check if it was set correctly. - Expanding the latent need for a setting control in a clear customer demand with a clear Value Proposition for the customer. - Composing a Duty Description usable for implementation of the project in the next phase of development. By carefully managing the interaction between the technical feasibility for a setting control and expanding the market research towards a clear Value Proposition for the customer, a setting control concept and a framework for a marketing fit were found. This was done by doing several development loops from the technical feasibility side and performing several interviews with both Hilti colleagues from market organizations, as well as external customer interviews and concept tests. The concept answering to the project target is a setting control system, that is built up out of a modified stud anchor, containing a different nut with a colored surface on the top, and out of a special socket, that limits the installation torque that can be applied to the anchor and leaves a marking in the colored surface of the nut of the anchor for inspectability purposes. This report shows the literature study and analysis for the optimized process, the development process that yielded a concept, a market introduction strategy and several conclusions and recommendations regarding the process and the continuation of this project within Hilti.","application; developement","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","2013-08-24","Industrial Design Engineering","Product Innovation Management","","Master of Science Strategic Product Design","",""

The main influences are the web as a new social medium, and sustainability. Go About is a free offering where workers can plan and register mobility right from Microsoft Outlook as an online service that is integrated in the calendar as a plug-in. They have the ambition to also sell mobility via this web service, They however seek a short term business model. The thesis explores the brand, and comes up with a strategy involving a business to business offering and a partnership with mobility consultants. This was made more concrete with a worked out offering: Go About Carbon. The mission Go About is to empower people to decide about their own (business) mobility. The goal is to take mobility out of the hands of the higher management and in to the hands of the people. This is a development that is already happening, and it will enable a free market of mobility providers aimed at people instead of business deals. Go About enables people to master their mobility. The brand values are to enable smart, sustainable, care-free and enjoyable mobility. The people are very important in this offering. The strategy is first to create a free offering making it easier for people to have a more diverse mobility. This is the outlook plug-in. Sustainable mobility is regarded as the most important element in business mobility. Sustainability of course is very broad; environmental sustainability is being acknowledged as the most important sustainability to work on right now by companies. The second and worked-out offering in this report is a B2B offering that enables to improve environmental sustainable mobility for companies on the basis of intrinsic motivation and extrinsic motivation in a context of empowerment instead of coercion. These three elements are pointed out as important success factors in enabling environmental behaviour change in literature. The offering is called Go About Carbon. It is a business to business offering that complements the free Go About offering. This offering is co-created and customized with mobility consultants, targeted at big to medium sized companies. This will enable paid development for Go About. After it is deployed for a number of companies, the result of the expertise and the software development can be turned in to a more scalable offering. This offering can be targeted at medium sized companies that do not hire mobility consultants. The revenue generated by Go About Carbon can be used to create this offering and marketing around the offering. During all this the free offering can be expanded. This will enable growth of the platform. At one point mobility providers can be given the opportunity to sell their mobility through Go About. Slowly the revenue from brokering fees will become the most important income stream.","mobility; service design; design thinking; behavioural change; sustainability","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Product Innovation Management","","Master of Science Strategic Product Design","",""

(mentor); Mattheijssen, P. (mentor)","2010","As the first stage of the amplifier chain aiming for the base station applications, a highly linear low noise amplifier (LNA) dictates very high performance for optimum coverage with a best signal quality. In today’s commercial market, the GaAs enhancement-mode pHEMT based LNA is dominant. However, a SiGe-based LNA, due to its high integration, is still attracting the interest from industry. In this thesis, the highly linear SiGe-based LNA design procedure is presented. For the fully-differential LNA design, the base tuning and emitter tuning, which both belong to the out-of-band matching technique used to increase linearity, are analyzed in details. Although the base tuning suffers more from mismatches in comparison with the emitter tuning, it is proved that proper choice of the harmonic trap capacitor is able to mitigate this effect, which can trigger a higher linearity. For the single-ended LNA design, the out-of-band matching is still feasible for narrow band applications. A compact topology of highly linear low noise amplifier which is composed of an emitter inductive degeneration and out-of-band matching core is proposed. Moreover, a modified neutralization function block based on on-chip transformer and bondwire inductor is also proposed. For this configuration, simultaneous noise/input matching, linearity improvement and a good reverse isolation is able to be achieved. It proved effective and convenient for a packaged monolithic RF chip. However, most input-referred linearity optimization techniques focused on the harmonic termination design at the input part, which leads to a narrower bandwidth and a higher noise figure due to extra losses in practice. To avoid these issues, an innovative linearity improvement method based on optimizing the output load is proposed. A novel two-stage highly linear LNA is designed to validate this theory. It achieved a power gain of 29dB and noise figure of 0.7dB at 1.7GHz, while only consumed 41mA from 3.3V supply. The OIP3 can be better than 38dBm from 1.2GHz to 2GHz. The input-referred 1dB compression point is -5dBm. The simulated result is the state-of-the-art among the current existing SiGe-based LNAs for base station applications. The design, as a part of a highly linear monolithic RF receiver, has been carried out using NXP QUBiC4x BiCMOS technology.","LNA; high linearity; base station","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2010-08-30","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Microelectronics & Computer Engineering","","Microelectronics","",""

(mentor); De Jonge, A.C. (mentor); Ursem, W.N.J. (mentor)","2010","Taxoid is a member of a class of anticancer drugs derived from Yew (Taxus species) trees. This includes paclitaxel and docetaxel, which have found wide commercial exploitation. Currently taxoids are extracted from the taxus species through chemical extraction from needles, barks and through cell culture. These are chemical intensive processes and destroy the tree in the process of extraction too. The concentration of taxoids in the trees is also very low. Thus to treat one patient (2 g of paclitaxel), six 60-100 year old trees are required. This has led the species to the verge of extinction. Also the cost of the drug is sky high at 36.5 per mg. Cheaper alternative to the natural paclitaxel do exist in the market but they have a much lower spectrum of curing ability. Hence doctors prefer to use the natural drug. Two researchers, Marijnissen & Roos (1998), who had been working on electrospraying over years, reported that when they applied a strong electrostatic field near the needles of the taxus species, they start oozing out taxoids. Due to the very nature of the extraction process, they named it as: Milking of Taxus. This technique of taxoid extraction provides a promise of sustainable, cheap and non-destructive (to the tree) cancer treatment. In order to develop this into a commercially viable process, Bob Ursem, Director of Botanical garden, alongwith Marijnissen and other researchers have initiated a multidisciplinary approach. The team includes experts from Biology, Electronics and Industrial Design. The aim of this thesis was to design a harvesting mechanism by bringing in coherence the knowledge and expertise of all the experts. The thesis begins with an analysis of current scenario of development. The following aspects of the milking process were known at the beginning of the project: - Electrospray based extraction of taxoids is possible - Creation of a strong enough electric field causes milking - Insulating the electrode will eliminate sparks and short-circuits - Seasonal variation of taxoid content in different taxus species - Multiple extraction from the same branch is possible after regular intervals The following aspects of the milking process were still to be established: - How to convert lab setup to milk an actual hedge? - How to increase the yield of electrospray from each needle? - Optimum electrode shape - The value of electric field that causes milking - Relationship between current and spraying - Properties of insulation material - Hedge shaping - Relationship between temperature, humidity, wind and spraying - How to ensure all needles in the hedge participate in spraying? - Farm system required - Exact recuperating time for the tree - Long term effect of milking on the tree - How long a needle can be milked? Project achievements - Designed an electrode more efficient than the lab instrument – a straight plate electrode - Designed a manually operated harvester and tested it successfully in the lab and the garden - Economic analysis conducted - Software aided calculations and experiments helped to establish an optimum electric field value - Insulation material suitable to the process identified - Indications for optimum time for a single needle harvesting obtained Salient features of the designed harvester are: - No hedge trimming required - Visually 80-90% needles appear to be participating in milking - Geometry of electrode more efficient than straight plate lab equipment - Entire branch can be milked at one go - Different needle and branch configurations present in 9 species of taxus can be addressed - Sparks, discharges and needle burning eliminated","taxus; cancer treatment; harvester; sustainable","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","2011-08-24","Industrial Design Engineering","Design Engineering","","","",""

(mentor); Boermans, L.L.M. (mentor)","2010","Over the last century lots of efforts have been put in the reduction of profile drag. By using advanced techniques in airfoil design, the passive ways to reduce profile drag by shaping have come to a standstill due to physical limits. To further reduce the profile drag, an active method has to be used. Boundary layer suction is one of these active methods and its effect is twofold. A laminar boundary layer will be stabilized, preventing transition and yielding larger areas of laminar flow, which generate less drag. On the other hand, turbulent boundary layer separation will be postponed, resulting in a higher maximum lift coefficient. In this thesis it is investigated how much improvement can be achieved by implementing boundary layer suction on the Euro-ENAER EE–10 Eaglet, a research aircraft of the Delft University of Technology. For this aircraft, a new airfoil has been designed in XFOIL which is optimized for boundary layer suction. The new airfoil proved to have good aerodynamic properties with and without suction and showed vast improvements in profile drag. Additionally, the maximum lift coefficient is increased significantly. Also the effects of boundary layer suction on flap and aileron deflection have been investigated. Results showed a significant decrease in drag and increase in maximum lift. With this newly designed airfoil, a new wing was created and its aerodynamic properties were calculated using the lifting line implementation of XFLR. The new wing proved to be more efficient, a drag reduction of 13% was achieved at cruise up to 20% at high flight speeds. However, the drag reduction of the total aircraft was marginally due to the high drag of the rest of the aircraft. At cruise the drag reduction of the total aircraft was about 3.2%.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","","","","",""

The public library branch is going through a renewal to withstand the decrease of library use. Less people, including children, are visiting the library since the nineties. Needs and expectations of customers have been changing and the library services should adapt to these changes. DOK wants to stimulate children, especially boys, to read. By making the searching process more appealing, DOK wants to make it nice and easy for children to find a book. The assignment for this master thesis was: Investigate the needs of the target group and based on that; design a product, service or combination that enables children aged between 9-12 to: Find a book they like, when they don’t know exactly what to read and enjoy the searching process. During the analysis, the information gathered through literature and experts raised questions. These research questions were answered in the user research phase through contextmapping sessions, video reports and class visits. The insights gathered in the user research phase functioned as input for the design phase in the form of design insights. The product, developed in the design phase, is finally evaluated and recommendations for DOK to further implement the design were made. The final design is a new system for children to return books. When children return a book they record a short video message with their opinion about the book. After taping the video the child places the book in one of the categories in the delivery box. On the children’s department a video closet is placed with the same categories as on the delivery box. In the video closet the librarian places the delivered books. On screens in the back of the closet the movies accompanying the books are played. The video closet and the delivery point are tested with prototypes in DOK.

(mentor); Diepeveen, N.F.B. (mentor); Albers, P.S. (mentor)","2010","The Delft Offshore Turbine (DOT) is a DUWIND research project that focuses on reducing the cost of offshore wind energy by bringing a radical change in offshore wind turbine technology. The main concept is to centralize electricity generation using pressurized seawater from individual wind turbine pumping systems. The idea behind the DOT is that the high power to weight ratio from hydraulic drive systems gives the opportunity for a reduced nacelle mass and increased reliability of components by eliminating the use of individual geartrains and generators. This thesis presents a first evaluation of the overall performance of a single DOT using a baseline rotor (from the NREL 5 MW offshore wind turbine) with a possible high tip-speed operation up to 120 m/s. A physical modelling approach was used, where the main system subcomponents from different physical domains (mechanical, hydraulic and aerodynamics) were modelled and integrated in a single environment with Matlab -Simulink. The steady-state response of the system was obtained as a function of wind speed. The main advantage of the DOT with a high speed operation is the possibility to get more mechanical power from wind speeds in the range of 12 to 17 m/s, with a power capture close to 8 MW. An overall system performance of 80% was obtained (including pump/motor efficiencies, friction losses), with a final electrical power output of 6.4 MW (28% more than the 5 MW reference turbine). Taking into account the wind speed probability with a typical offshore Weibull distribution for the North Sea, a gross annual energy production of 24, 991 MWh was obtained (2% less with respect to the 5 MW reference turbine). A 30 kW testbench was used to validate experimentally the performance of the hydraulic transmission used in the computational model, resulting in deviations of 2 to 8% of the predicted performance.In general it can be foreseen that the success of an offshore hydraulic turbine will not be dictated by the individual power performance but by the potential reduced cost and increased reliability of the overall system.","Windenergy","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","Wind Energy","","Sustainable Energy Technology","",""

(mentor); Wisse, M. (mentor)","2010","TU Delft Bio-Robotics Lab. developed a new type of robotic arm, called a macro-micro actuated system for the inherent safety characteristics in human-interaction environment. The macro-micro actuated system is equipped with a macro actuator and a micro actuator which works together to control one joint angle. The macro actuator is connected to the link through a low stiffness spring, and the micro actuator is directly connected to the link. This was designed successfully to have the inherent safety of the robot arm. However, there remains the challenge of controlling the manipulator to possess the inherent safety with high-bandwidth performance and robustness, when the robot arm performs pick-and-place work of an unknown mass. In this paper, first, the macro-micro actuated system of the Delft robot arm is introduced. Second, the control challenge to have safety with high-bandwidth performance is discussed along with possible control schemes for their successful implementation. In the chosen control scheme, Balancing/Tracking mode, the macro part is controlled to compensate for gravity and the micro part is controlled to realize the desired trajectory. Third, a feedback linearization method with a sliding mode algorithm and an indirect adaptive algorithm is surveyed to decrease nonlinearities of the system and to have robustness. For a fast estimation of an unknown variable and simplicity of a control algorithm, the sliding mode algorithm is applied to the chosen control scheme with the feedback linearization method. Finally, the Balancing/Tracking scheme with the feedback linearization method and the sliding mode algorithm is proposed as the controller of the macro-micro actuated s ystem.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Delft Center for Systems and Control","","","",""

(mentor)","2010","This thesis argues that natural complex systems can provide an inspiring example for creating software which incorporates emergent, self-organizing and adaptive properties. The advantages of complex sys- tems are their natural resilience, redundancy and adaptivity. A generalization of neural networks and boolean networks called computational networks is presented as a model for complex systems. It is argued that this model satisfies the required properties for modeling complex systems. Furthermore, it is asserted that a computational network, being a network of mathematical functions, is appropriate for solving classification problems. For the design of computational networks an evolutionary design algorithm is constructed. Additionally, four extensions of this algorithm are presented. Each extension is inspired by natural evolution and theories from the evolutionary computing literature. An impor- tant component is a novel generative representation which can reuse substructures of computational networks. Experiments with this component have shown that it facilitates a higher level of complexity in the solution space, improving the computational network performance for more complex problems. Other components steer the evolutionary process towards a desired solution, either by introducing spe- cial stages during evolution, or by smoothing the fitness landscape. The experiments show that complex systems can be evolutionary designed to act as a classifier. The resulting computational network has a better performance on the Iris dataset compared to every classifier in the Weka classifier collection. Furthermore, an experiment was conducted using the TIMIT read speech dataset, the classifier was evo- lutionary designed using only 13 MFCC features, and a very small train set. Although the performance is not good enough to be of any practical use, the results are adequate given the limitations of the train data.","complex systems; evolutionary design; emergence; self-organization; adaptation; computational networks; biological inspiration","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Department of Mediamatics","","Man-Machine Interaction","",""

(mentor)","2010","Field biologists and ecologists have started to open a new avenue of inquiry at greater spatial and temporal resolution, allowing them to “observe the unobservable” through the use of wireless sensor networks. Study of birds has helped to develop fundamental knowledge of bird behavior, foraging pattern and migration. The acquired knowledge of birds has contributed to build concepts, like evolution, and applications, such as mitigating risk of bird-strikes and protecting endangered species. Traditional bird life monitoring approaches, like satellite telemetry are not capable to provide the insights in a greater resolution and suffer from large delay to deliver data. In this thesis we present the communication mechanism of BirdTracking, a wireless sensor network to observe bird life for a complete annual bird-cycle. One of the main challenges of a sensor network formed by devices attached to birds is the disrupted connectivity due to mobility and habitat of birds. We propose CHIRP, a routing protocol that utilizes the behavior and mobility of birds to transmit sensor data to a collection point. In order to evaluate CHIRP, we implemented it on a wireless network simulator over a mobility model created by real life traces of a colonial bird (gull) and a territorial bird (honey buzzard). We compare CHIRP against direct transmission and an epidemic routing scheme. Our simulation results show that CHIRP achieves significant improvement in data delivery as compared to direct transmission while consuming less resources than the epidemic routing scheme.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Software Technology","","Embedded Software","",""

(mentor); Acar, M. (mentor); Van der Heijden, M.P. (mentor); Apostolidou, M. (mentor)","2010","This research work aims to gain understanding of the power amplifier (PA) operating as a linear PA under low power drive conditions and as a switch-mode PA in high power drive conditions both with the same Class-E load. Two approaches were taken here. Firstly, an analytical approach was developed to investigate the switching operation of conventional Class-E amplifier. The model used in the analytical approach takes into account the non-ideal switch resistance, finite dc-feed inductance, finite loaded quality factor, and arbitrary switch duty-cycle. This approach presents an accurate closed-form expression for modeling Class-E power amplifier. Using this approach, the frequency response of conventional Class-E power amplifier was studied in detail and the impact of the loaded quality factor and finite dc-feed inductance on the broadband performance was analyzed. It shows that the Class-E PA with conventional load network cannot provide stable output power, efficiency, and reliable operating voltage conditions across a broad frequency band (Bandwidth > 40%). In addition, study of the load impedance of the amplifier indicates that the Class-E PA is sensitive to the load phase angle at fundamental frequency. In the second approach, a purely linear voltage-control current source was constructed numerically as a way to represent the transistor. Based upon that model, the influence of non-ideal drive signal on the switching operation was studied. It shows that the power amplifier with finite dc-feed inductance is tolerant to a non-ideal drive signal. For the rise and fall times of 25%T, only 5% drop in drain efficiency was found for the optimum finite dc-feed inductance. The performance of that model in linear operation was also investigated. The results agree with the classical theory for linear power amplifiers. The linearity (intermodulation distortion and 1dB compression point) was analyzed by using a realistic transistor model (an extended drain NMOS). It shows that the Class-B biased PA with finite dc-feed inductance can provide not only similar IMD3 feature as the optimum Class-AB biased PA with RF choke does, but also high efficiency simultaneously. Based upon this device, a systematic design process was applied to implement a broadband high efficiency Class-E PA. The PCB for this broadband high efficiency Class-E PA was fabricated. Good agreement was found between the simulation and measurement. The measurements indicated that the PA achieves a drain efficiency >67% and a PAE >52% with a Pout >30dBm from 560-1050MHz, where the output power variation is within 1.0dB and efficiency variation is within 13%. The highest efficiency is observed at 700MHz from a 5.0V supply with peak drain efficiency of 77% and peak PAE of 65% at 31dBm output power and 17dB power gain. When using dynamic supply modulation, the PA achieves a PAE of 40% and a drain efficiency of 60% at 10dB power back-off across the frequency band 500MHz to 1100MHz.","high-efficiency class-E; CMOS broadband power amplifier (PA); circuit analysis","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2010-08-24","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Microelectronics & Computer Engineering","","Microelectronics","",""

Loss of aggregates from the pavement surface, called raveling, is the most common form of distress in porous asphalt. There are several factors that contribute to the accelerated failure or raveling of porous asphalt and among them ageing is believed to be the main reason for raveling failure of porous asphalt. It increases the chance of damage development because of applied traffic loading and thermal stresses at low temperature. During design phase of pavement, it is imperative to know beforehand what the properties of the pavement will be after field ageing. This will help to minimize maintenance cost due to premature failure and to increase the confidence level of the design of the pavement. It is evident; therefore, that there is a need for accelerated laboratory ageing method that can simulate binder properties similar to that of field aged binder.

(mentor)","2010","The rapid rates of sea level change in the Caspian Sea since its formation (Proterozoic) have resulted in unique sedimentary sequences, including many oil and gas reservoirs. An important hydrocarbon province is the fine grained-sandstone of the Productive Series in the South Caspian Basin that consist for at least some part of sheetflood sandstones. Their sedimentology and reservoir architecture remain uncertain. This study reconstructs the chrono-stratigraphic framework of the low-gradient North-East Caspian plain between the Ural and Emba Rivers, and its potential as a reservoir analogue for Productive Series. Because of the similarities between the sedimentary systems, like rapid sea level changes and the absence of a shelf break. The data for this study consist of 26 shallow core- and 10 outcrop-descriptions and include the analyses of selected samples for Optically Stimulated Luminescence dating, radiocarbon dating and grain-size distribution analyses. Three sea-level cycles (I-III) were identified depositing four different sedimentary sequences (a-d): (I-a) marine clays (41 ka BP) followed by a regression resulting in an erosional surface, (II-b) transgressive shallow marine silty clays and sandy barrier deposits (16-17 ka BP) (locally identified as ‘Khvalynian chocolate clays’), (II-c) Terminal Splay Complex consisting of clayey sands (9-11 ka BP) related to a major regressive event, that are eroded into a deflation landscape (e.g. yardangs), locally known as ‘Baer-hills’ and Sors’ and (III-d) present day inter-yardang deposits lagoonal- and playa- like deposits consisting of fine silty clays. Preservation of these fines is closely related to sea-level oscillations. Possibly a fourth sea-level cycle occurred before 41 ka BP depositing marine clays. The identification of a Holocene terminal splay complex and yardang-formation gives new insight in the regional sedimentary processes. More importantly this complex could serve as a new analogue for the Productive Series, giving alternative insights in reservoir architecture and internal connectivity, e.g. the Productive Series could be more terrestrial of origin despite the absence of evidence for sub-aerial exposure.","North Caspian Sea; Terminal Splay Complex; Holocene; sea level changes; Optically Stimulated Luminescence","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Applied Earth Sciences","","Applied Geology","",""

The focus of this thesis is to develop a complex and integrated system that addresses the challenges of dynamic traffic assignment in modern times. To reach this goal we had to study the theory behind such systems, come with new ideas and implement them into a real world human-centered traveler information system. Taking into account state of the art systems in this field we built a design for a Personal Advanced Traveler Assistant (PTA). The main purpose of PTA is to give routing advices depending on the users preferences and the available capacity in the network. The system incorporates a dynamic traffic algorithm that employs a prediction model. The prediction model should use current traffic updates and the routes of the guided cars in order to achieve an accurate prediction of the future traveling times. Next step was to implement a prototype. This is available through multiple interfaces like smart phones or desktop applications. The prediction model that the algorithm uses is based on historical data. Given the time constraints the prototype uses now only historical data but it can be easily extended to include live updates. This allowed us to build a prediction model that considers typical traffic dynamics in order to estimate the traveling time. The performance measure of the traffic assignment algorithm is the shortest traveling time. The algorithm that we implemented is a time dimensional-extended version of the Dijkstra algorithm. The algorithm is tested on real data collected from the highways in The Netherlands. We evaluate the performance of the algorithm by comparing it to two versions of the static Dijkstra algorithm. To conclude, we successfully implemented a working prototype that uses various technologies such as Java, the Open Street Map API for rendering the map or J2ME for the mobile phone client. The prototype that we have built represents a working proof of concept for a dynamic routing assistant. One advantage of the structure that we chose to implement is that each component can be further on extended independently. In this way we showed that such a system is feasible but we also left the possibility for different parts of the system to be extended into more advanced applications.","traffic; dynamic routing; intelligent assistant; mobile tracking","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2010-09-10","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Man Machine Interaction","","Media and Knowledge Engineering","",""

Technologically, the focus would be on bamboo, as an environmentally friendly renewable material. The aim of this graduation assignment is twofold, Technological and Substantial (that is, pertaining to Content). The goal is to develop a sustainable toy, product, system or service-oriented solution, as an environmentally friendly means for joyful and experiential knowledge and skill acquisition, while the sustainable values of playing correspond to contextual, technological and commercial environmental measures. This, with the intention of elaborating the WBCSD approach of ""creating more with less impact ""toward ""creating more value with less (environmental) impact1"". The goals of the sustainable toy design are a design of a bamboo toy within a context which creates a balanced blend of the following: Substance - Commitment to social responsibility today and for the coming generations. Technology - Implementation of technology-based ecological considerations. Economy - Reliance on profit-based market appeal upon market forces. The parameter for successful merger of these three would be, in the words of the WCED, ""development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs2”. - Can toys leave behind a positive footprint on our environment, just as they left in our minds? - 1.

But the shortest route is different from the fastest route in time. Because existing routing algorithms lack the ability to react to dynamic changes in the road network, drivers are not optimally routed. In this thesis we present a multi-agent approach for routing vehicle drivers using historically-based traffic information. The general workings of our solution bears strong similarities with Ant Based Control (ABC) and AntNet, but an important modification has been made, namely the adaptation of ant-like agents for spatio-temporal routing. The dynamic routing algorithm proposed, routes self-interested drivers on an intersection to intersection basis via the fastest path between a proposed source and a destination. For this to happen, a time-expanded graph encodes variable road network costs. Ant-like agents are launched in this graph. They use a technique of collective learning based on locally dependent pheromone tables. Finally, we report results obtained for part of The Netherlands' GIS-based road network. In the established experiment setting, the new ABC makes a positive difference for drivers. An important reduction of the travelling time was observed in 53% of the cases. The experimental results also showed that ABC clearly outperforms Static Dijkstra's algorithm and Dynamic Dijkstra with updates.","Ant Based Control; ABC; Dynamic; Routing","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2010-08-25","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Man Machine Interaction","","Media & Knowledge Engineering","",""

In this thesis, the effects and limits of the concept of Morfac in coastal morphodynamic modeling are studied from a 1D analytical model with unidirectional flow, and the model with numerical implementation. After linearized and non-dimensionalized, the sensitivity of the Morfac is analyzed based on investigating Froude number, sediment transport facto, friction parameter, Courant number and points per wavelength. The criteria of the Morfac is derived both from stability and accuracy. Forcing parameters such as the flow velocity magnitude is the dominant factor while the model properties like the grid size and time step play a minor role. A necessary stability criteria is derived for this specific 1D case. In the analytical and numerical models, Morfac performs better than in the Delft3D model. A strong recommendation is to further improve the numerical implementation of Delft3D which may extensively increase the value of Morfac we can use.","Delft3D; eigenvalue analysis; morphological acceleration","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","Coastal Engineering","",""

(mentor); Visser, T. (mentor); Van den Dries, J. (mentor)","2010","This thesis project is completed as part of the Product Planning and User Experience team at Vodafone Netherlands. The main objective is to create a new mobile communication concept based on the vision to make people feel closer to each other. This report proposes a context-aware communication called Airmail that enables people to send messages to particular places at a specific time, allowing the recipient to have the right context when receiving the content of the message. <Background: Innovation that fits the brand and enhances the experience> One major escalation of a brand is a shift from the end into the beginning of an innovation. In order to maintain the company’s prosperity, Vodafone is expected not only to provide satisfactory services but also a value offering that emphasizes the experience. Hence, the challenge for future innovation is to create services that fit the Vodafone brand, as well as enhances the mobile communication experience. <Problem statement: Physical proximity is not always an option> Since people are becoming more and more mobile and live scattered across the globe, being connected in terms of physical closeness—or physical proximity—is not always an option. <Analysis: Communication over a distance> The foremost important value in mobile communications is that it enables a connection between people, not only by means of a functional connection but also providing an emotional connection. Although people have hundreds of contacts listed in their mobile phone, approximately 80% of the communication is only done with four people in their inner social circle. Communicating over a distance allows the feeling of closeness, making people feel valuable and that they belong to their social circle. However, this feeling of closeness—or in other words, perceived proximity— in mobile communication is not always enhanced by the richness of the information (such as in video call), but also by the engagement of the mind through what is called mental representation. This mental representation is an imaginative state of mind, where people in distant places emotionally feel closer to each other. It is influenced by the context of communication such as the type of relation, or the situational context, in other words when and where the communication takes place. <Concept: Airmail, a context-aware communication> With the communication concept called Airmail, people will be able to send a message to a particular place at a specific time. This way, the recipient will receive the message at the right time and place, allowing for a vivid experience in perceiving the content of the message. For instance, even if when people are away from home, they could send a “Good night, sleep tight” message to the bedroom of their loved one, and still, the message will reach the recipient once he/she goes to bed in the evening. Or people could recommend a restaurant near the Eiffel Tower to their friend who is traveling to Paris. Although they are not sure when he/she will visit the place, the message will reach the recipient once he/she comes across the Eiffel Tower. This concept is designed to use a simple platform (i.e. the SMS channel) in combination with an Internet channel, allowing it to reach as many people as possible, without depending on the mobile device or the network provider.","Mobile Communication; Vision in Product Design; Experience Design; Brand Driven Innovation; Service Design","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","2011-08-23","Industrial Design Engineering","Industrial Design","","Strategic Product Design","",""

It has proven a major exploration challenge in the area to predict the reservoir quality of these fields based on seismic data only. The effect of salt present in the area plugging the pore space leads at first sight to similar seismic responses on post-stack data as for gas filled reservoirs. This study aims to gain better insight into the (subtle) differences in seismic response induced by water-, gas- or salt-fill scenario. The approach adopted is by studying the seismic response at various existing wells in one of the fields and the corresponding seismic responses of the processed 3D seismic survey. First a thorough analysis of the log responses of 13 wells is made and the effect of a.o. depth trends, compaction, diagenesis and facies changes to the seismic response is qualitatively investigated. Then, a match between the log data and the poststack seismic data is established by creating synthetic seismic data. Finally by using fluid substitution and more recent solid substitution theory, subtle changes in seismic response, both pre-stack and post-stack, between the different porefills are predicted. Based on these modeled predictions recommendations are made concerning the type of data analysis that should be carried out to discern the different porefills on the seismic data. The results of this research should lead to an improved characterization of the Buntsandstein reservoirs and as a consequence, to a higher success rate in drilling (i.e. less “dry wells”).","exploration challenge; seismic response; synthetics; reservoir quality; improved characterization; post-stack; pre-stack; Buntsandstein","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Geotechnology","","Applied Geophysics and Petrophysics","",""

(mentor); Van Kuijk, J. (mentor)","2010","This reports describes the results of an Industrial Design (IPD) graduation project that was carried out in the Human Interaction & Experiences department of Philips Research Eindhoven. The user-centred design process resulted in a product that facilitates weight management by means of mindful eating. At the start of the project, existing literature on ‘mindful eating’ was explored. In addition, interviews with potential end-users were carried out, to explore interesting directions for innovative products in the area of mindful eating.. It was concluded that users were not interested in a product that solely enhances mindful eating, but they preferred to use mindful eating as a tool for weight management. Six design directions were defined, of which the search areas ‘portion size’, ‘slow down eating rate’ and ‘second serving timer’ were believed to have most potential for Philips Research. The focus of the project was specified as ‘preventing people from taking a second serving at dinnertime by means of mindful eating’ in relation to weight management. The three selected search areas, also called design directions, were studied in literature and analyzed by means of BJ Foggs’ behaviour model for persuasive design. As it appeared that long-term behaviour change was an important aspect of the design, an existing venture within Philips, called DirectLife, was also analysed to examine how their methods could be applied to this project. The conclusions were combined in a preliminary design brief. Next, ideas were generated by means of brainstorms and sketching. Six ideas were developed into scenarios; two per design direction. The scenarios were shown to 12 participants with an interest in weight management and led to the idea choice for the scenario ‘chopping board’. Subsequently, this scenario was evaluated by two nutrition experts and two members of the DirectLife team, which resulted in a design brief. The focus of the project shifted towards the design of a chopping board that provides feedback on portion size and is positioned as an extension of the DirectLife brand. Based on the design brief, three concepts were developed that differed on several aspects, such as usage, interface, and material selection. The three concepts were evaluated during a user test in Philips’ ExperienceLab by means of mock-up models. The results from the user test were unambiguous: all participants preferred the concept ‘slim as an ordinary chopping board’. This concept was developed into a preliminary design, which included the design of the tangible product, the interface and the integration in the DirectLife portfolio. The preliminary design was evaluated in the kitchen environment of Philips’ ExperienceLab by means of a working prototype. Ten participants were instructed to cook a recipe and determine their portion size by means of the prototype. The results suggest that the product could be effective in facilitating the user to eat more mindful in order to manage his/her weight. The participants had a positive attitude towards the product and the additional DirectLife Food program. Their remarks indicated that nearly all criteria and requirements specified throughout this project are satisfied. Long term effect of the usage of this product should be studied in a longitudinal study.","mindful eating; portion size; eating behaviour; prototype; chopping board; kitchen scale; mindless eating","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","2011-08-20","Industrial Design Engineering","Industrial Design","","Master of Science Integrated Product Design","",""

(mentor); Peck, D. (mentor); Sweep, M. (mentor)","2010","That less unsustainability is not equal to more sustainability is something that is not being recognized in many current strategies said to be dealing with the twin crisis of climate change and/ or resource scarcity. If sustainability is defined as a community taking care of it’s own needs and flourishing in ways important to it, that means that the community needs to learn to function independently. But what if the inhabitants of that community has no ‘we’ feeling, let alone a ‘why’ to act sustainable? This was the issue that was adressed for Deltawind int his project: a wind energy cooperation in the Dutch island of Goeree-Overflakkee. The companies’ interest was in exploring how the behavior of the islands inhabitants could be changed so that it would become a more sustainable island. Interviews, an online questionnaire and a contextmapping study were conducted. Inspired by other online developments the concept developed into an online platform for a do-good-community, both uniting and empowering the island inhabitants. The community has 4 monthly reoccuring themes: energy & environment, health, knowledge & culture and society. The concept creates a synergy between awareness, inspiration and the ability to act alone & together. Where sustainability is normally blocked out by other more pressing concerns, it is now connected to ‘caring’ and ‘doing good’ and putting it in a local context. By appealing to the strong emotional connection island inhabitants feel with their island and using the rich volunteer- & club life to battle the negative attitude that seems to inhibit cooperation. Barriers are taken down, a ‘buzz’ of positivity is created, inhabitants are reconnected to each other and possibilities are opened up. Inspiration: a pass-it-on-compliment makes visible how many people are doing good and taking care of each other. With 10 of these thank-compliments circulating around the island, the complex social structure becomes visible, showing that there actually are no ‘divisions.’ Individual behavior and attitude change: the Challenge-of-the-month adresses various ways of how people can make small contributions. Leaving a message of how you have contributed is rewarded by an receiving a special offer by a company sponsoring the Challenge. This advertisement space is for free if the company invests the money thus saved by investing it in making their business a more responsible one. Collective empowerment: a do-good-marketplace where offers and calls for help can be posted. Trades can be proposed and help asked for developig ideas. Sustainability will only be reached by putting many different solutions into place, no single concept can do this. But this particular one facilitates a mindshift in the right direction. It creates the right atmosphere for change: it puts sustainability in a framework that is relevant on a local level. The designed platform is a practical tool that empowers the community to take control and turn their ideas into actions.

(mentor); Lopes, G. (mentor)","2010","Reinforcement Learning (RL) is a popular method in machine learning. In RL, an agent learns a policy by observing state-transitions and receiving feedback in the form of a reward signal. The learning problem can be solved by interaction with the system only, without prior knowledge of that system. However, real-time learning from interaction with the system only, leads to slow learning as every time-interval can only be used to observe a single state-transition. Learning can by accelerated by using a Dyna-style algorithm. This approach learns from interaction with the real system and a model of that system simultaneously. Our research investigates two aspects of this method: Building a model during learning and implementing this model into the learning algorithm. We use a memory-based modeling method called Local Linear Regression (LLR) to build a state-transition model during the learning process. It is expected that the quality of the model increases as the number of observed state-transitions increase. To assess the quality of the modeled state-transitions we introduce prediction intervals. We show that LLR is able to model various systems, including a complex humanoid robot. The LLR model was added to the learning algorithm to generate more state-transitions for the agent to learn from. We show that an increasing number of experiences leads to faster learning. We introduce Prioritized Sweeping (PS) and Look Ahead (LA) Dyna as possibilities to use the model more efficiently. We show how prediction intervals can be used to increase the performance of the various algorithms. The learning algorithms were compared using an inverted pendulum simulation, which had to learn a swing-up control task.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Delft Center for Systems and Control","","","",""

(mentor)","2010","Dutch freeways suffer from severe congestion during rush hours or incidents. Research shows that 64% of congested traffic during rush hour consists of commuter traffic [30]. A traffic congestion increases travel time, resulting in a delay for travelers. Reliable travel time predictions are essential for Dynamic Routing, in which travelers can be rerouted to avoid congestions. Travel times can be calculated from vehicle speed [41] in case of free flowing traffic. In case of congestion, we will make an estimation error regarding the travel time. Therefore, an accurate speed prediction model is necessary. In this thesis, the predictability of the average vehicle speed by Bayesian Networks is investigated. A case study is conducted where several Bayesian Network models we propose are evaluated for a well known traffic bottleneck in the Netherlands. We show that Bayesian Networks are capable of predicting the start or end of a congestion at the bottleneck reasonably accurate for a prediction horizon until 30 minutes. Further, we propose a prediction model based on historical data, which is able to predict the average vehicle speed at the bottleneck location for longer prediction horizons. In the end, we propose a hybrid model which combines our Bayesian Network and our prediction model based on historical data. This hybrid model is able to predict a traffic congestion with an accuracy of 85% for a prediction horizon of 2.5 hours. The results of our case study show that modeling traffic using Bayesian Networks is promising.

(mentor); De Vries, L.J. (mentor); Kunneke, R.W. (mentor); Slootweg, J.G. (mentor)","2010","The introduction of large numbers of Electric Vehicles (EV) poses significant challenges to the power infrastructure. The combination of expected consumer recharging behaviour and the technical characteristics of the EV’s recharging power demand could potentially lead to significant increases in peak demand and cause overloads. Conventional asset management in distribution network planning is to invest in grid reinforcements to accommodate the expected future peak demand. But, this strategy would result in an significant increase in the currently redundant energy capacity during off-peak hours. In addition to such inefficiency, the long lead times and high costs of reinforcements have led DNO Enexis B.V. to search for alternative strategies. One such strategy is to manage EV recharging demand within the grids’ capacity constraints. EV recharging is presumed to be highly time-flexible and may therefore be interruptible, schedulable and potentially susceptible to economic incentives. If coordinated properly, large numbers of EVs could be accommodated without deterioration of service reliability. Our research was aimed to design such a coordination mechanism for this specific purpose. We concluded that any coordination mechanism should include a DNO operated demand control mechanism which interrupts the recharging in response to overloads. For technical and economic efficiency considerations, the interruption of EVs should be selective. Methods by which the individual consumer is selected may be based on technical criteria or economic differentiation such as bids or prices. Real time dynamic pricing methods were judged insufficient in resolving overloads because of concerns about the level of consumer price response and the differences thereof between consumer categories. The different technical characteristics of Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEV) and Battery Electric Vehicles (BEV) led us to conclude that their related consumers’ level of response to prices may be absent in some cases and will at least be insufficiently reliable. The alternative technical selection methods, although their discriminatory nature is in conflict with current legislation, are considered preferable over economic selection methods. Such methods could provide BEV consumers, which are critically dependent on the grid and may have a recharging necessity, priority over other (PH)EV consumers. Technical selection based interruptions may not require transactions such as compensations in the early phases of EV adoption. As long as grid energy capacities are still readily available and the EV consumer does not necessarily experience any loss of service due to interruptions. Scarcity of energy capacity, however, may occur soon at local level grids and cables. In addition to response to overloads, an ex-ante mechanism which can spread out recharging demand in time should be considered to limit the frequency of DNO induced interruptions as well as to optimize the utilization of the grid in the longer term. We concluded that the current Dutch legislative environment prohibits DNOs from active planning and scheduling of recharging demand on behalf of EV consumers. Although operated with reliability objectives, such activities effectively constitute an energy supply service which, additionally, would be competitive with similar services offered by energy providers. Alternatively, DNOs should consider introducing price incentives by substituting or supplementing the current fixed connection capacity charges with a usage based network charge. Out of the four rate designs considered in this study, static Time of Use pricing was considered to best meet the DNOs cost objectives as well as consumers’ cost and comfort objectives. Concluding, a coordination mechanism consisting of Time-of-Use pricing accompanied by selective interruptions for real time reliability are proposed. Interruptions of recharging should be based on selective methods which differentiate between consumers on technical criteria. Such a method is considered discriminatory and will likely require institutional changes.","electric vehicle; recharging demand; power distribution; congestion; demand side integration","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Technology, Policy and Management","Energy & Industry","","Systems Engineering, Policy Analysis & Management","",""

Especially the public party is blamed for not fulfilling its role in the D&C process. This research has created a framework of success factors that should lead to a successful D&C project. The research shows that public clients have difficulty with fulfilling their role as they want to keep control on the design and are not used to their new role. Furthermore, conflicting interest and expectations between the client and contractor are a burden on fulfilling the success factors. These deviations are, however, understandable. The public client has a representative role and has to take into account the desires and interests of a lot of stakeholders. The current literature on D&C projects needs to be improved by taking into account the role of the public party. Future research should be focused on increasing the amount of analyzed D&C projects. Furthermore, more attention should be given to the role of the private party.","design and construct; public client; framework for success","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Technology, Policy and Management","Multi Actor Systems","","Policy, Organization, Law & Gaming","",""

The work presented in this report focuses on the investigation and comparison of different measurement principles and techniques used to measure the key device parameters resonance frequency and compliance. The first generation MEMS microphones that are developed by NXP are influenced by mechanical vibrations that reduces the device performance. Therefore, new techniques will be implemented to reduce this noise and these techniques are based upon matching the frequencies of two flexible plates in the microphone sensor, we investigate these resonance frequencies in this thesis. This investigation is performed with two different measurement techniques : electrical impedance measurements and laser vibrometer experiments. These measurements are performed in air and vacuum conditions and the influence of ambient pressure, bias voltage and back volume on the resonance frequency is investigated. The vacuum measurements are in good agreement with the finite element simulation results. Additionally the results obtained from different measurements are compared and the difference between the results are analyzed. Finally, recommendations are made for future measurement conditions and setups.","electrical characterization","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2015-08-19","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Microelectronics & Computer Engineering","","ECTM Group","",""

De door ons gevonden oplossing diende te worden ondersteund met een implementatie in EVE, het visualisatieplatform van TNO. Nadat het Plan van Aanpak2 geschreven was zijn we meteen overgegaan tot het onderzoek3. Dit onderzoek bestond voornamelijk uit het proberen van bekende editors. De meesten hiervan kwamen uit de games industrie en waren om deze reden makkelijk te verkrijgen. Tijdens dit onderzoek hebben wij ons vooral geconcentreerd op de gebruikersinterface, de besturing van de camera en de wijze waarop objecten in de wereld geplaatst kunnen worden. Het onderzoek hebben we uiteindelijk afgesloten met een door ons voorgestelde oplossing. In deze oplossing visualiseerden wij hoe het eindproduct eruit moest gaan zien zonder te kijken naar een onderliggende implementatie. Aan de hand van de resultaten van het onderzoek en de wensen van de opdrachtgever stelden wij het Programma van Eisen4 op. Hierna maakten wij op basis van de kennis die we tot dan toe hadden opgedaan over EVE het systeem ontwerp5. Omdat EVE een hoop dingen bleek te kunnen die wij niet in de documentatie hadden gevonden moest het systeem ontwerp in de eerste instantie meerdere malen worden aangepast, meestal betekende dit dat we meer hadden ontworpen dan nodig was. Zo eindigden wij met de twee belangrijkste klassen, een klasse die de acties van de gebruikersinterface afhandelt en een klasse die de camera acties afhandelt. In de loop van het project liepen wij geregeld tegen problemen aan. Vaak wilden we iets gebruiken dat door EVE niet werd ondersteund. Uiteindelijk lukte het ons vrijwel elke keer om op een alternatieve manier alsnog het gewenste resultaat te bereiken. Soms hebben wij hiervoor, met toestemming van de opdrachtgever, de implementatie van EVE moeten aanpassen. Terug kijkend op het resultaat concluderen wij dat we onze doelstellingen hebben behaald. We hebben een prototype afgeleverd waarmee eenvoudig en snel een scenario opgezet kan worden (zie de demonstratie video in de bijlage). Onze begeleider en opdrachtgever reageerden zeer positief over het door ons afgeleverde product.

(mentor); Ruiter, I.A. (mentor)","2010","The initial assignment, as formulated by Corners and Curves for this graduation project was to improve the rocking add-on for a baby’s stroller, focusing on the clamping mechanism. During the first phase became clear that also the movement could use improvement, and so an exploration started from off the beginning of the soothing methods and motion in particular. The existing rocking stroller add-ons are all big and supposed to put under the entire stroller. Since half a year one more modest stroller rocker is on the market, so a market potential is present. The clamping was a problem because of the variety of strollers it has to fit on. The new design eliminated this problem by a mechanism that does not need clamping, but mountening/tightening instead. By means of a webbing, it fits on the five types of most sold big-framed strollers, and probably on more. The current market for baby products is overwhelmed by large colourful and shiny plastic products, where as the parents lifestyle gets more sober and natural. The style of this product is a mix of designer toy and natural materials, combined with the safety needed for babies. It works by a crankshaft variation called scotch yoke: instead of an attached connecting rod to the turning crank, the crank-end is guided in a horizontal slot, causing an up and down motion with no risk of getting stuck in its top and bottom dead centers.","baby; rocking; soothing; hand-held; stroller","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Industrial Design","","","",""

(mentor); Kling, W.L. (mentor)","2010","The demand for electric power keeps on growing and electrical power networks are becoming more interconnected. This is a trend in many countries of the world that is caused by increased customer requirements and advanced technological improvements. In order to meet the ever-increasing energy demand, the integration of new power sources in the grid is necessary. This is a big challenge due to bottlenecks such as transport capacity, voltage fluctuations, fault levels and reactive power. The great challenge lies in the design of a network, with a smooth voltage profile and limited short circuit currents. The smart-grid vision and the newest High Temperature Superconducting (HTS) cable technologies, can offer solutions for these issues. HTS cables will have a smart behavior, because they have an improved non-linear voltage-current characteristic. This innovative characteristic is caused by the non-linear resistance of the HTS cable. During normal operation the cable resistance is very low, resulting in low energy losses and smoother voltage profile. While the non-linear resistance increases very fast during short circuits, a significant reduction is caused in the fault currents. This physical Fault Current Limiting (FCL) cable property is analyzed for the connection of a power plant with a 150 kV FCL HTS cable. An EMTP-ATP draw model is developed by using MODELS language based on the R ~ It characteristics of FCL HTS cable. Short-circuit current analysis are carried out for this model, with and without the FCL HTS cable. When a fault occurs and the results are compared, the FCL HTS cable is capable of limiting the fault current. For this model the generator terminal voltage and the Transient Recovery Voltage (TRV) have been analyzed. When a three-phase to ground fault occurs, the generator terminal voltage stays within the specified limits. The results of the TRV analysis are compared with the standard value that is allowed by the IEC.","High Temperature Superconductor; Fault Current Limiter; Transient Recovery Voltage; Short-circuit Current; EMTP-ATPDraw; High Voltage","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2010-10-18","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Electrical Sustainable Energy","","Electrical Power Systems","",""

(mentor)","2010","Peer-to-peer networks rely on gossip algorithms to spread information about the peer activity and the network status. State-of-the-art gossip algorithms are not sufficient to spread the information widely, as the size and the complexity of the unmanaged networks grow. They suffer from high bandwidth utilization and lack mechanisms to verify the validity of the transferred information. We set the following questions for research: How can we achieve high coverage ratio for all the peers in the network while using as little bandwidth as possible? How can such a mechanism scale to millions of nodes? How can we reduce the effects of high churn rates? And finally, how we secure that the data transmitted are genuine? We develop Splash, a data synchronization algorithm with emphasis on high data coverage and efficient bandwidth usage. Our solution is based on Bloom filters and allows both partial and full synchronizations while avoiding the transmission of duplicate information. We propose two schemes to synchronize current and historical data between peers, over unmanaged and untrusted peer-to-peer networks. We use a SyncLog to keep the state of the synchronization algorithm to a minimum. For scalability we categorize data based on their origin, as local or global, and we investigate the use of different synchronization policies. Finally we discuss mechanisms that validate data to prevent the spread to invalid information. Through a series of experiments we present the effectiveness of this solution in networks with different sizes and churn effects. In simulation Splash achieves 95% data coverage for all the peers in the network, which is 5 times more compared to BarterCast. Additionally Splash uses 107 times less bandwidth compared to BarterCast to achieve the same data coverage.g","peer-to-peer; data synchronization; tribler; gossip","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Parallel and Distributed Systems","","Computer Engineering","",""

(mentor); Koppenjan, J.F.M. (mentor); Annema, J.A. (mentor); De Jong, W.M. (mentor); De Jong, M. (mentor)","2010","In recent years, Latin America has experienced a rapid urbanization process, which leads to the increase of transportation demands in their main cities. In light of this, governments are working to enlarge infrastructure in the transport sector. However, some limitations such as the availability of public funds for enormous investment in these projects make it impossible for the government to promote new projects. These constraints have led some countries to develop agreements with private partners in order to promote new delivery methods such as Public-Private Partnerships (PPP) in the transport sector. This new approach has been used in different regions including Latin America. Peru, with its urban rail project - Lima Urban Rail - is using one of the schemes of PPP, but with peculiar characteristics that have not permitted to finish the project since 1986. Other countries, such as Argentina and Brazil, have already had a history of PPP in the same sector, but with discouraging results. PPP also carries many new challenges for transportation projects. Thus, achieving success in this area and specifically knowing what influences the success of PPP projects, is not a straightforward task. In other words, this research aims to know the path to achieve success in PPP projects in Latin America through the study of the most influential factors. Therefore, considering this motivation, this research first studies the theory of Public-Private Part- nership (PPP). In this context, the analysis of the benefits and detriments of PPP are examined in detail in order to understand the issues that first hinder the success in these projects. Moreover, the definition of success in our environment is defined in relation to the different phases of the project (Contract Success, Implementation Success and Post-Implementation Success). This is particularly important because it allows us to create a new theoretical framework of the most important factors that influence the success of a PPP project. In other words, a set of factors related to the context and to the project itself are extracted by theory providing the creation of a framework of important factors in PPP. They served as input for evaluation through the different cases of studies. Thus, in order to evaluate this framework, we examinated four PPP cases in the urban rail or subway sector in Latin America. These cases correspond to subways/urban train of the cities of Rio de Janeiro, Sao Paulo, Buenos Aires and Lima. This analysis was focused on the study of the relevant factors which can produce or disturb successful projects in Latin America. Moreover, the review of the main characteristics produced important reflections on our work. First, the Latin American plan lacks a long-term vision for the durability of their projects. Most of the Latin projects failed to provide an acceptable quality of service after some years of implementation. Transport failures embrace problems in the frequency of the trains, bad maintenance of stations and poor security personel. Some of the sources of these issues are encountered on the lack of funding guarantees to support the durability of the project and the poor monitoring system of some PPP units. Secondly, three factors were found as critical in all the phases of a PPP project: Institutional & Legal Environment, Political & Socio-Economic Environment and Risk Allocation. The Institutional & Legal Environment of Latin countries is characterized by the lack of transparency law, independent judicial system but with some progress in unifying PPP laws. The Socio-Economic Environment is distinguished by the volatility which can reach long periods of economic growth but also long periods of unexpected economic crisis. The Risk allocation is still a challenge that can affect the total duration of a project. Thirdly, a new set of framework which fits in the Latin environment was contrasted, making real recommendations for the Peruvian government and general suggestions for Latin governments. These findings gave new light upon the success of PPP projects in Latin America. Among the most important recommendations in order to achieve success, we can advise the Peruvian government to create a new guarantee fund in order to deal with possible economic crisis. The Peruvian economy can be very changeable and thus the government should be prepared to face any probable economic risks. Moreover, the congress should also work on establish a new transparency law in PPP projects. The information of all the phases of the project should be opened to public in relation to the different phases of PPP. Public participation is important on the acceptance of high-investment projects, thus it should be included in the process of the projects. Furthermore, an independent monitoring system for the long-term of the project is a “must”. The research showed that the long-term duration of a PPP project in Latin America can not be easily achieve due to the lack of monitoring methods through the life of the project. Additionally, we also suggest to the Latin governments to see PPP as a new model for the market. Some of the projects are done independently without looking at previous experience and thus the same mistakes are made. Projects can be an example of new ones, creating a new market for other cities. Finally, government should also give some incentives or penalties in order to deter private parties from strategic behavior, providing stimulus to accomplish their goals. These are feasible recommendations in the specific Lima case and general Latin projects, however it will also depend predominatly on the commitment of the parties to overcome the detriments of PPP projects. Taken the definition of “success”, emphasizing on the context-related factors and risk allocation and using our created framework, recommendations based on the most important factors influencing the different parts of the projects are put forward, aiming at building up an efficient transport environment for Latin America and in the case of Lima.","Public-Private Partnership; Latin America; subway; Critical Factor","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2010-08-19","Technology, Policy and Management","Policy,Organization, Law and Gaming","","Engineering and Policy Analysis","",""

Using reverse ordering to the original heuristic shows a significant performance increase. A new method for finding 1-autarkies is introduced in UnitMarch, in combination with the addition of autarky resolvents. This is done as a preprocessing technique and during the solving process. The learning methods for indirect implications, failed literals and necessary assignments are introduced to UnitMarch as global learning methods. Failed literals are expanded to failed clauses. Necessary Assignments optimally use the structure of multi-bit assignments. UnitMarch 2.0 demonstrates a good performance increase with the succesfull integration of the complete solver techniques.

(mentor)","2010","Indonesia as one of the state members of UNESCO committed to achieve main goal of Education for All (EFA) UNESCO which is to improve education quality in the world. The education quality is inseparable from the teacher quality. Therefore the UNESCO and Indonesia put high concern to improve the teacher quality. Since Indonesian Government put high effort to achieve the UNESCO goal, the policies need to be evaluated in order to analyze whether those policies have met the criteria of EFA-UNESCO or not. A policy recommendation is presented if the policies are not effective to improve the teacher quality in Indonesia. Three research questions are answered in this research: (1) To what extent has the Indonesia government met the teacher quality of EFA? (2) What factors influence the criteria that have (not) met the EFA goal? (3) What role can the Ministry of National Education put to support the Indonesian government to achieve the EFA goal in more effective way?. In order to answer the research questions, three major methods were used: desk research, interviews, and policy analysis using causal relation diagram and multi criteria decision making. The desk research includes the literature studies of the related institutions reports such as UNESCO and Ministry of National Education. The interviews are executed via telephone to the related actors. The causal relation diagram is used to analyze the problem by capturing the teacher quality system and to identify what are the influencing factors. The policy analysis methods like system diagram, means end diagram, and actor network analysis is used to analyze what policy means can be proposed to solve the problem. Lastly, the proposed policy robustness is tested using a scenario analysis. Based on six criteria from Task Force on Teacher for EFA (TFTA) UNESCO, Indonesia is considered to fulfill the number of teacher needed, gender balance in teaching profession, and has good policies to improve teacher quality. However Indonesia still has to increase the student survival rate, lower the student repetition rate, and has to train and recruit many teachers. Indonesia is categorized as a country with the moderate level of achievement. When we look deeper to the Indonesia teacher condition and compare the assessment based on TFTE UNESCO criteria and Indonesian Government criteria, we can capture a different conclusion. According to UNESCO criteria, Indonesia fulfilled the teacher number needed but the unbalance teacher distribution leads to shortage number of teachers in many areas, especially the rural areas. The UNESCO also concludes that the gender balance in teaching profession has been achieved but we can see gender disparities since more male teachers are holding undergraduate degree. Moreover although the certification policy to improve the teacher quality is good in its implementation; a problem occurs after a teacher is certified. Many teachers cannot acquire their professional allowances because they cannot fulfill their obligation to teach 24 hours. There are two big problems which hamper the teacher quality improvement: (1) the unbalance teacher distribution between cities and rural areas and (2) the high teacher workload. The unbalance teacher number hampers teachers to fulfill their obligation to teach 24 hours per week. Meanwhile the high teacher workload limits teacher self-study time. The formulation of new teacher distribution management policy at province and national level is recommended to balance the number of teacher in the rural areas and the cities. When the district cannot fulfill their need of teacher, the province government helps to manage the teacher movement from one district to other district within the province; and when the province cannot fulfill the need of teacher, the Ministry facilitates the teacher movement from one province to other province. Meanwhile comprehensive teaching method development is recommended to reduce the teacher workload and to increase their quality. This comprehensive teaching method includes the teacher guidebook, student book, evaluation book and innovative teaching tools.","teacher quality; policy; Indonesia","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Technology, Policy and Management","Multi Actor Systems","","Policy Analysis","",""

(mentor)","2010","Wind power evolution in Northern Europe is foreseen to continue in the future with development of large-scale wind power plants (WPPs) on far offshore. Integration scheme of these WPPs to the onshore grids would grow from point-to-point connection to a transnational multi-terminal network where the transmission capacity serves both to evacuate the wind power and to facilitate power trading between countries. In such a situation, application of multi-terminal VSC-HVDC transmission is considered the favorable technological solution. A control strategy which capable of accommodating different dispatch schemes is however required. This thesis presents a control strategy for dispatching power in the future transnational network situation. The control strategy is developed based on the voltage-margin method and is customized to comply with different dispatch schemes possibly be applied in the future transnational network. The control strategy is implemented on a multi-terminal VSC-HVDC network representing the future transnational network and its capabilities are confirmed through simulation studies for normal and abnormal operations. For normal operation, the capability to dispatch the offshore wind power as well as the traded power among the onshore grids is explored under wind speed changes. For abnormal operation, the capability to interchangeably control the direct voltage upon disconnection of a direct voltage controlling converter is examined. In addition, the compatibility of the control strategy to work with particular low voltage ride-through mechanisms is reported. The control strategy, the multi-terminal network and the simulation studies are implemented in MATLAB/Simulink.","wind power integration; multi-terminal VSC-HVDC; voltage-margin method","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Electrical Sustainable Energy","","Electrical Power Systems","",""

(mentor); Hegyi, A. (mentor); Wiggenraad, P.B.L. (mentor); Baggen, J.H. (mentor); Schreuder, M. (mentor); De Vries, Y.W.R. (mentor)","2010","Door de toename van de mobiliteit wordt het steeds drukker op de Nederlandse autosnelwegen. Het is echter onmogelijk, en ook onverantwoord om de wegcapaciteit grenzeloos uit te breiden. De doelstelling van de wegbeheerders is dan ook om de bestaande wegcapaciteit beter te benutten, oftewel efficiënter gebruik te maken van het Nederlandse wegennet. Een voorbeeld van een benuttingsmaatregel is de toepassing van dynamische maximumsnelheden, waarmee de snelheidslimiet kan worden afgestemd op onverwachte en wisselende situaties zoals weer, drukte of een ongeval. Hiermee kan de doorstroming worden verbeterd, de verkeersveiligheid worden vergroot en de milieubelasting worden beperkt. Om een uitspraak te kunnen doen over de bredere toepassing van dynamische maximumsnelheden is in de literatuurstudie gekeken onder welke omstandigheden dynamische maximumsnelheden een positief effect op de doorstroming kunnen hebben, waarbij het aantal voertuigverliesuren zoveel mogelijk wordt beperkt. Hieruit blijkt dat vooral de regelfilosofie bepalend is voor het effect op de doorstroming. De eerste regelfilosofie is gericht op het beperken van de instroom door tijdelijk de snelheid te verlagen, waarmee filegolven kunnen worden opgelost. Als dynamische snelheden gecombineerd worden met toeritdosering kan de instroom nog meer worden beperkt en kunnen filegolven rondom toeritten beter opgelost worden. Een tweede regelfilosofie verhoogt juist de snelheid in de randen van de spits van 80 km/u naar 100 km/u, waarmee het ontstaan van congestie kan worden uitgesteld. Deze regelfilosofie is vooral toepasbaar in 80 km-zones waarbij weefbewegingen moeilijker verlopen door homogeen rijgedrag. Een andere mogelijke regelfilosofie is gericht op homogeniseren en maakt gebruik van snelheden rond de kritische snelheid. Hiermee kan de doorstroming echter niet verbeterd worden. Aan de hand van deze kennis is een regeling ontwikkeld waarbij dynamische maximumsnelheden gecombineerd worden met toeritdosering. Deze vernieuwde regeling kan er voor zorgen dat er meer filegolven op te lossen zijn en dat filegolven sneller opgelost kunnen worden. Ook is er een methode ontwikkeld waarmee locaties kunnen worden geselecteerd die geschikt zijn voor de toepassing van dynamische maximumsnelheden waarbij de doorstroming zoveel mogelijk wordt verbeterd. De methode bestaat uit grofweg drie onderdelen; vaststellen van het type file, de locatieselectie en de maatregelspecificatie. Mogelijke typen files zijn filegolven, staande files bij toeritten of doorstromingsproblemen in 80 km-zones zijn. Afhankelijk van het type file worden locaties op een andere manier geselecteerd. In een globale selectie worden trajecten met filegolven geselecteerd op basis van i/c verhouding. Staande files kunnen geselecteerd worden op basis van de filelengte bij de toeritten. 80 km-zones kunnen geselecteerd worden op basis van doorstromingsproblemen die veroorzaakt worden door een bottleneck binnen de 80 km-zone. Vervolgens kan er in meer detail naar de trajecten gekeken worden. Hiervoor moet eerst lusdata voor een representatief aantal dagen in Monigraph verwerkt worden. Op basis van deze data kunnen de verschillende typen files worden geïdentificeerd. Bij staande files en filegolven kan op basis van schokgolftheorie bepaald worden of door het beperken van de instroom de files oplosbaar zijn met dynamische maximumsnelheden en toeritdosering. Onderzoek naar het verschil in capaciteitsval tussen staande files en filegolven moet duidelijk maken wanneer staande files oplosbaar zijn met dynamische maximumsnelheden. Voor het bepalen van de mogelijke uitstel van files in 80 km-zones kan gebruik gemaakt worden van de resultaten van de proef op de A12 bij Voorburg en historische data. Uit de detailanalyse en de oplosbaarheid volgt de mogelijke winst in voertuigverliesuren. Op basis daarvan kunnen de trajecten worden gerangschikt. In de maatregelspecificatie wordt beschreven hoe een geschikte benadering voor een traject gekozen kan worden en hoe de maatregel verder uitgewerkt kan worden. Hierbij kan gedacht worden aan de lengte van het traject, het soort algoritme en de toepassing van toeritdosering. Aangezien de meeste benaderingen met dynamische maximumsnelheden gericht zijn op het oplossen van filegolven, is de methode alleen voor dit type file getest in een casestudy. Eerst is er een globale selectie gemaakt van locaties. Van tien willekeurige trajecten uit de selectie is data verwerkt in Monigraph. Op acht trajecten traden daadwerkelijk filegolven op. Om een beter beeld te krijgen van de trajecten die geselecteerd zijn, zal echter van meer trajecten data in Monigraph verwerkt moeten worden. Vervolgens is er in meer detail gekeken naar de A2 tussen Holendrecht en Oudenrijn en de A15 tussen Hendrik Ido Ambacht en Gorinchem. Het aantal filegolven ligt op de A2 hoger dan op de A15 en na het bepalen van de oplosbaarheid van filegolven bij toepassing van dynamische maximumsnelheden in combinatie met toeritdosering blijkt dat op de A2 ook meer winst in voertuigverliesuren valt te behalen. De procentuele winst ligt op de A15 echter hoger, door de lagere frequentie van filegolven. Het effect van toeritdosering is echter beperkt. Dit heeft vooral te maken met de lage intensiteiten op sommige toeritten en de aanwezigheid van staande files rondom toeritten, waardoor de filegolven als niet oplosbaar worden beschouwd. Deze staande files kunnen mogelijk ook met dynamische maximumsnelheden en toeritdosering worden opgelost. Voor de verbetering van de ontwikkelde regeling met toeritdosering wordt aanbevolen om ook rekening te houden met de aanwezigheid van afritten en andere toeritten die verder stroomopwaarts liggen. Hierdoor komt het regelschema beter overeen met de werkelijkheid. Hierbij zijn metingen van intensiteiten op de toerit met detectielussen noodzakelijk als de regeling in de praktijk wordt toegepast. De volgende stap is het uitvoeren van een simulatiestudie en een praktijktest met de gekozen benadering om zo het effect op de doorstroming beter te kunnen bepalen.","","nl","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Transport & Planning","","","",""

(mentor); Guldenmund, F.W. (mentor); De Jong, M. (mentor)","2010","Lack of relevant research has motivated the initiation of this MSc thesis project with the fundamental objective to contribute to the knowledge about a direct or indirect influence of national culture on safety incident reporting in a hazardous industry. The relevance of this topic is related mainly to the fact that the literature review on national culture frameworks stresses the influence of culture on several aspects of social life, including the workplace, where incident reporting is, or should be taking place. It is hypothesized that incident reporting will be influenced, amongst others, by national culture. This hypothesis is supported by the literature review of safety science, which reveals a set of cultural barriers to effective incident reporting. Besides, various studies indicate that underreporting is pervasive in hazardous industries. At the same time, cement industry worldwide admits low safety performance; therefore, an Hellenic based cement producer and worldwide distributor was approached to participate in the study in order to identify the factors that can describe best the workers’ attitudes towards incident reporting and the statistical correlations of those factors with the selected cultural dimensions. For the purpose of this study, Hofstede’s Values Survey Module ’94 and an additional set of questions, which was used in order to identify the respondents’ attitudes towards incident reporting, were delivered and answered by the employees of a cement plant based in Greece. Although the number of responses marginally met the requirements for the selected statistical techniques, the data was analyzed using the Statistical Package for Social Science (SPSS). According to the results of the data analysis, the research sample was found to represent the research population, apart from the number of the production department employees, which was found to be statistically higher than the one in the research population. The scores on Hofstede’s cultural dimensions were also calculated and compared to those found in literature. As it was expected, a deviation between the empirical and theoretical scores was found; however, the results revealed similar patterns between the calculated and the original indices reported by Hofstede. Next, the data analysis revealed two components that describe the perceptions and attitudes of the sample towards incident reporting: “Safety participation, awareness and trust” and “Motivation to compromise safety”. According to the responses, the employees that answered the questionnaire understand the existing safety rules in the plant, know what to do in order to follow those rules, understand that they carry personal responsibility for an accurate implementation and believe in the importance and effectiveness of incident reporting and safety procedures within the plant. At the same time, the respondents show low motivation to compromise safety vis-à-vis other occupational tasks, since they do not believe that it is acceptable to break safety rules and they trust the way management manages safety. In the final phase of data analysis, the strength and direction of the relationships between each of the selected cultural dimensions items and the safety attitude components were explored, in order to evaluate the formulated hypotheses regarding the influence of each cultural dimension on incident reporting behavior. All the hypotheses were rejected. The employees’ perceptions and values towards incident reporting were not related to their cultural values; therefore, any kind of direct or indirect influence of national culture on safety incident reporting was not found to be plausible. Given the fact that the literature review revealed a lack of research on the influence of national culture on safety incident reporting, this research has added a small but important amount of knowledge to safety management in hazardous industries. Considering the limitations that apply to this study, which are also discussed in detail, the proposed methodology can serve as a starting point for a more thorough research project on safety behavior discipline.","national culture; safety culture; incident reporting; Hofstede","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Technology, Policy and Management","Safety Science Group","","MSc Engineering and Policy Analysis","",""

(mentor); Van Bussel, G.J.W. (mentor); Pavel, M.D. (mentor); Sieberling, S. (mentor)","2010","The basic model of the principle of crosswind power as described by Miles M. Loyd in 1980 (Loyd, 1980), promises a high energy revenue from airborne wind energy. With a growing awareness of the need of sustainable energy resources and the current technological possibilities, different initiatives are undertaken to harvest the energy of wind at higher altitudes. One of these initiatives is the Powerplane, which makes use of a glider type aircraft with a wing span of 36 meters for producing 1 MW of electric power. The aircraft flies patterns in the sky such that it produces a high tension in the connecting tether. The system generates power as the tether is unwound from a drum located at the ground under this high tension. When the tether is fully unwound, the aircraft performs a dive while the tether is quickly retrieved with a minimum tension. The difference in tension during retrieval and unwinding allows net energy to be generated. Before the 1 MW Powerplane can be put on the market as a working system, several technological hurdles must be taken. A conventional wind turbine is always remotely situated at its operational altitude as soon as it is installed. On the contrary, the Powerplane needs a method to get there. Therefore one of the main design challenges is the step between an idle state on the ground, and generating energy at operational altitude. This challenge is the main objective of the research done in this thesis: to find out how the aircraft can be launched and retrieved such that the Powerplane will be a competitive system for wind energy generation. There are many different ways for doing this, but which way is most feasible? To answer this question, first of all the main requirements a launch and retrieval system has to comply with are outlined. A functional analysis lead to different design options, of which the most interesting options where analysed more extensively by various methods. Combining promising design options gave three concepts. One concept based on buoyancy, a concept making use of propeller thrust and one which uses a rotational platform to launch the aircraft. Analysing these concepts in a trade-off resulted in abandoning the buoyancy concept, but the other two required more research. This resulted in an improvement of the propeller thrust concept by combining it with a circular runway. The operating principle of the rotating platform concept is analysed by means of computer simulations.Even though the results of the simulations where promising, they where not convincing. Before a definite decision on the concepts can be made, more research is required. The effect of the added weight of the propeller thrust concept should be determined by studying the Powerplane concept in general. The concept of the rotational platform needs to be investigated more to make sure that the operational altitude can be reached without additional equipment. Nevertheless, the research outlined in this thesis and the recommendations made, provide a firm basis to find the optimum solution for launching and retrieving the aircraft. I hope the content of this research will help to make the concept of Airborne Wind Energy a step closer to becoming a world wide success.","Airborne Wind Energy; Windenergy","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2013-07-09","Aerospace Engineering","FPP","","","",""

Information such as the context of the conversation and the characteristics of the speaker can make the task of recognizing speech more accurate. The challenge is how this knowledge can be incorporated in the model of Automated Speech Recognition easily. The answer to this challenge is in using Dynamic Bayesian Network as the model of Automated Speech Recognition. Dynamic Bayesian Network makes extending Automated Speech Recognition model with new knowledge easier by representing the new knowledge as new variable(s) in the model. However, having these variables designing the most optimal model is still not an easy task, especially when there are a large number of variables. In this thesis, a mechanism is developed to learn the Dynamic Bayesian Network model of Automated Speech Recognition system automatically. In essence, this mechanism can be decomposed into two important components, namely metric and search algorithm. The metric is a quantitative measure of how optimal the model is, while the search algorithm defines the process of learning the most optimal model. This thesis will focus on the model of ASR that has to do with the choice of word in a sentence and put less focus on the acoustic part of the model. For this purpose, a list of possible metrics and search algorithms are presented. For each of this metric and search algorithm, the details of the implementation are also provided. By testing each metric and search algorithm with artificial language and real conversational language, it will be discussed which metric and which search algorithm is suitable for learning the model of Automated Speech Recognition.","Artificial Intelligence; automated speech recognition; language model; model learning; data mining; Bayesian Network; search algorithm","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Man-Machine Interaction Group","","","",""

This master thesis shows the development of the TU Delft's second edition Drive-by-Wire scooter platform. The BY-WIRE is a flat, electrically driven universal platform, which uses drive-by-wire technology. The aim of the BY-WIRE platform is to form a bases for all kinds of upper bodies, not just for scooters but for a much wider range of two-wheelers. In 2008 the first BY-WIRE project started and ended up with an experimental first prototype; ‘the BY-WIRE 1.0. Currently the BY-WIRE 2.0 is released. The goal for the BY-WIRE 2.0 was to improve the BY-WIRE 1.0 on several aspects. Mainly the steer-by-wire system needed much attention. It was also a goal to provide the BY-WIRE 2.0 a better and more professional finishing; ready to expose on exhibitions to encourage people for this project! Furthermore, it needed to be investigated to add extra flexibility to the platform. The BY-WIRE 2.0 is big step forward in the development process of a flexible, safe and proper driving universal scooter platform with DbW technology. Many aspects of the BY-WIRE are successfully improved. In addition the BY-WIRE 2.0 is even more flexible because it has an extendable wheelbase and adjustable suspension stiffness. I can also be very proud with the high-end appearance. The BY-WIRE 2.0 envisions the goal of this project so much more and definitively encourages people to proceed this project. The driving behaviour of the BY-WIRE 2.0 is better than the BY-WIRE 1.0, though there is room for further improvements in order to have a driving/ steering behaviour, which is similar to what we are used to; a conventional scooter. Why should the BY-WIRE make success? A universal scooter platform is particularly useful for scooter manufacturers. Like in the car-industry; using one platform for several upper bodies. In the end, this will result in cost reductions both for manufacturers and customers. DbW combined with electric drive trains also offer the opportunity to create entirely new upper body designs. These upper body designs can be made adjustable during usage. Shifting the steering interface, seat and rear wheel (throttle-by-wire) is possible because wire connections are the only interposing elements. In the end the BY-WIRE platform incites to expand the usage area of a scooter, or a two-wheeler in general! The BY-WIRE fits future mobility very well because it combines flexibility, manoeuvrability and a zero emission drive train.","BY-WIRE 2.0; universal scooter","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Design Engineering","","Master of Science Integrated Product Design","",""

(mentor)","2010","We are living in a knowledge society. Knowledge is considered as the most important production good in western societies nowadays. This study aims at gaining insights into the presence of knowledge and the conversion of knowledge into innovations at firm level. Three main concepts are used: information availability, absorptive capacity and innovation output. The concept of information availability is derived from geographical economics. The availability of information increases as the number of firms, knowledge institutions, suppliers and customers increases that are located at proximity [Porter, 2000]. Absorptive capacity is a concept that is defined as: “the ability of an organization to recognize the value of new, external information, assimilate it, and apply it to commercial ends” [Cohen and Levinthal, 1990]. Innovation output is concerned with the number of innovations and the type of innovations that firms introduce on the market. The hypothesis is that both information availability and absorptive capacity have a positive influence on innovation output. The data for this study was gathered from firms in the medical high technology sector. Considering the growing problem of ageing of the population in Western countries, innovative solutions are needed to make patient healthcare more effective. The firms are between 2 and 21 years old and have between 2 and 200 employees. Of the eleven cases in our sample, five firms are located in the South East of the Netherlands and six firms are located in the Randstad. These two regions show a different pattern of urbanization. A rough-set approach is used that can deal with small samples and fuzzy data. The data was gathered through questionnaires and interviews with respondents of the sample firms. No quantitative relation has been found between the location of a firm in the Netherlands and product innovation output. It seems that medical high tech firms benefit from a location closely to one Academic Medical Center (AMC) with which a strong relation has been built. More than one closely located AMCs does not lead to more product innovation output for a firm. To benefit from proximity, some of the respondents indicated that a firm should be located so close to an AMC, that a doctor can walk from the hospital to the firm and back during a coffee break or lunch. Considering firm location, ‘proximity to AMCs’ and ‘degree of urbanization’ turned out to be similar. Five AMCs are located in the Dutch metropolitan area (the Randstad) and three AMCs are located in different smaller urban areas outside the Randstad. The (qualitative) findings suggest that networks are more important to firms than being located in a metropolitan area or close to knowledge institutions. Locations and regions are considered to create conditions for firms. Variables as degree of urbanization and number of closely located AMCs are exogenous. The actual use of these conditions are endogenous and belong to firm characteristics. The number of face-to-face meetings firms have appears to positively influence product innovation output. Firms that have more external face-to-face meetings can exchange more information, that leads to the creation of more innovations. Both organizational and individual antecedents have been subject of this study. The Chief Innovation Manager (CIM) is a person in the organization who facilitates or initiates change and translates information for creation of innovations. The CIM is particularly relevant for absorptive capacity in Small and Medium Sized Enterprises (SMEs). Firms with a CIM that has specialized knowledge about marketing seem to have less product innovation output than firms that have a CIM without specialized knowledge. It seems that CIMs with specialized knowledge about marketing are able to select the most fruitful innovations. Organizational antecedents of absorptive capacity are education and experience level of the firm, and firm mechanisms. The experience level of firms with respect to marketing appeared to be negatively related to product innovation output. This is not a surprising outcome, since employees that spend their time on marketing are not able to spend their time on inventing and realizing product innovations. Firm mechanism, like connectedness and socialization tactics, are aimed at making communication and collaboration in an organization more effective. In this study, a positive influence of firm mechanisms on innovation output was not found. The influence of marketing- and product absorptive capacity on marketing- and product innovation output could not be tested. The medical high tech firms appeared to have too little marketing innovation output. A conceptual split in absorptive capacity related to a specific knowledge field or knowledge source seems relevant as other scholars have shown in earlier research [Murovec and Prodan, 2009; Schmidt, 2010]. Future research should give additional insights into types of absorptive capacity and knowledge fields to which it is related. The conceptualization of absorptive capacity as linked to antecedents of key managers (as the CIM) needs more attention in our opinion. Certainly in SMEs, the CIM plays an important role in the innovation process. In the literature, an extensive theoretical background of individual antecedents of absorptive capacity is lacking [except for Waalkens et al., 2008] and validated measurement instruments that can be used to assess the competences of key managers. The body of literature concerning ‘product champions’ [Markham and Aiman-Smith, 2001] could prove helpful in future research about individual antecedents of absorptive capacity.","geographical econmics; absorptive capacity; innovation output","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","2010-08-13","Technology, Policy and Management","Innovation Systems","","Economics of Innovation","",""

This MSc project aims at study the DEMS’s control module in order to visualize entirely the performance and behavior of an autonomous distributed generation system for electricity and district heat supply which operates under DEMS. The result of this project is a stable, robust and appropriately simple as possible control strategy that satisfies the aims established for the DEMS. This control strategy performs according to the optimal operation points determined by the Optimization module, maintaining the energy demand of electricity and heat properly satisfied every time.","autonomous distributed generation system; control strategy; distributed energy management system; energy hub; multiple energy carriers","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Electrical Sustainable Energy Department","","Electrical Power Systems group","",""

(mentor)","2010","At the University of Colombo School of Computing (UCSC) a new e-learning based Bachelor of Information program has been set up. One of the given courses is focused on the Office skills of the student. For this course a new tool should be developed to assess practical tests automatically, so the teacher does not have to assess tests manually. This report is focused on the assessment of skills in Microsoft Word, Excel and Powerpoint. The feasibility of this is investigated and an approach has been found. A tool has been developed, which can be used to assess the word-, spreadsheet- and presentation- processing skills described by the International Computer Driver License (ICDL) standard. First a procedure for taking a test has been made. The test consists of a printed document with some instructions about for example the used letter types. The student should reproduce this document, using his skills. The resulting document will be matched with a model answer, provided by the teacher and assessed using a marking schema. The system has two documents. Now the main problem is to compare these documents. The documents are stored in Microsoft OOXML format, which can be easily read by the tool. The problem of OOXML is that it is not directly comparable. Different structures can be used to represent the same document and a lot of useless data is present. A new format – the DocumentElement format - has been created which has only one possible representation for the same document. Also all non-ICDL data has been removed. The DocumentElement format is a tree of DocumentElements – like paragraphs, pictures, tables, cells – with properties assigned to these elements – like lettertype, size and color. To create a DocumentElement from an OOXML file the use of parsing technology has been suggested. Three levels of parsing are needed to create this format. The first level is parsing the XML file into an object-oriented representation. The next level is parsing the object-oriented representation into a raw DocumentElement representation. To do this, the parser will be provided with some expert data. This data contains information about the relevance of the DocumentElements. The elements and properties that are not mentioned by ICDL or not important to the teacher will be removed. The last level of parsing is the DocumentSweeper. Some extra rules are added to the system to remove the last peaces of useless data. After both documents have been parsed, they can be compared. Using a marking schema provided by the teacher a mark can be given. This part needs some extra investigation, because the used algorithms are exponent ional, so limitations are build in to avoid explosion of execution time. This could cause errors and unjust marks in some cases. A tool has been developed using this techniques and the results are promising. The differences between the marks given by the teacher and the system are in most of the cases beneath 10%, which is acceptable. The developed tool therefore seems to be useful and quickly applicable at the UCSC.","OSAP; e-learning; ICDL","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Computer Science","","Bsc.

The prediction of loads on turbine blades is based on the performance of its two-dimensional profiles. Profile performance is measured in the windtunnel and the data is corrected for the constraint the tunnel walls impose on the flow. For bodies subject to fully separated flow, tunnel wall corrections are based on empirically derived methods and for two-dimensional profiles spanning the windtunnel testsection, Boorsma (2003) has shown these methods to be relatively inaccurate.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","","","","",""

(mentor)","2010","The majority of currently established public-key cryptosystems, e.g., RSA, ECC, requires modular multiplication in finite fields as their core operation. As a result, the throughput rate of such cryptosystem depends upon the speed of modular multiplication and upon the number of performed modular multiplications. Montgomery algorithm is one method that allows efficient implementation of multiplication modulo large number, as required by the RSA cryptosystem. In the recent years, renewed interest has been payed to Residue Number Systems (RNS), due to their ability to enable parallel and fast modular arithmetic. Within RNS any integer is represented with a set of its residues with respect to a given base that comprises a set of relatively prime integers. In this way RNS distributes large dynamic range computations over small modular rings. Thus the computations are carried out independently in each of the small wordwidth RNS channels. Since the RNS is particularly suited for performing efficient long integer modular arithmetic, the Montgomery algorithm was adapted such that it can be utilized in conjunction with RNS. RNS Montgomery modular multiplication makes use of two representation bases B and B', and during the calculations requires two base extension operations. Such a base extension involve the calculation of the residue digits with respect to \(B'/B\), when the digits relative to \(B/B'\) are known, and dominates the RNS Montgomery modular multiplication computational complexity. This thesis evaluates existing base extensions methods and proposes a new improved approach, which makes use of the linear Diophantine equations theory. Assuming that \(B\) and \(B'\) are \(k\)-moduli sets, to derive the value of \(k\) new residues, our method requires \(k^2\) regular multiplications and \(k\) modular multiplications, while equivalent state-of-the-art methods require, depending on the extension sense, \(B\) to \(B'\) or \(B'\) to \(B\), \(k^2+k\) and \(k^2+2k\) modular multiplications, respectively. When utilized in the RSA context, our method provides a speedup of \(O(\mu)\) relative to the stateof-the art, where \(\mu\) is the ratio between the computation time required by a modular multiplication and by a regular one. To better asses the practical implications of the proposed method we implemented RSA based on state of the art and on the Diophantine theory and compared their performance. For the evaluations we assumed various RSA keysizes, \(e = 2^{16} + 1 = 65537\), different RNS moduli sets with varying cardinality (\(k\)=4, 5, and 6), bitlength and Hamming weight, and various messages to encrypt. Our experimental results indicate that for sets of 4, 5, and 6 moduli with bitlength of 512-bits, our method provides a speedup per Montgomery kernel of 1.93, 2.42, and 3.17, respectively.","Residue Number Systems; RNS base extension; Montgomery modular multiplication; RSA cryptography; diophantine equations","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Microelectronics & Computer Engineering","","Computer Engineering","",""

(mentor); Yang, Q. (mentor); Hendriks, E. (mentor)","2010","High speed feature point detection and tracking is very demanding for many realtime computer vision applications. In existing work, the commonly used feature point detection algorithms like Harris and KLT (Kanade-Lucas-Tomasi) and feature tracking algorithm (Pyramidal-KLT) were redesigned to increase the performance by reducing the algorithmic complexity, resulting in the Low Complexity Corner detector (LOCOCO) and Robust Low Complexity Feature tracking (RLCT) algorithms. To attain further speedup, this report proposes the implementation of these low complexity detection and tracking algorithms on a massively parallel architecture of the modern graphics processing units (GPUs) using Compute Unified Device Architecture (CUDA). In the computing domain, due to semiconductor scaling limits and associated power and thermal challenges, combined with the difficulty of exploiting greater levels of instruction level parallelism, a paradigm shift is happening from a single core to many-core processors and massively multi-processing platforms. High performance is now available on single-chip commodity GPUs. Moreover, GPUs are no longer limited to graphics applications, but are emerging as usable general purpose computing devices. Advancement in such platforms, are making many computational intensive problems that were solvable only on supercomputing systems, to be computed on desktop systems, at a reduced price, and lower power requirements. The arrival of this new generation of low-cost high performance computing platforms presents both numerous opportunities and challenges. In this report, we present the use of such high performance many-core GPU platforms to obtain speedup by mapping general purpose computations to massively parallel architectures. It is observed, when properly executed, GPU adaptation of algorithms can result in significant savings in computation times. For an image size of 960x960 pixels, the low complexity corner detector and robust low complexity feature tracking algorithms are factor of 16 and 25 times faster on a GeForce 280 GTX GPU than the corresponding implementation on an Intel Core 2 Duo, 2.66 GHz, and 2GB RAM CPU.","CUDA; corner detection; feature tracking; GPU","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Computer Engineering","","","",""

This has been previously thought about, and the biogrouting technique has already been verified in the laboratory to work in a well (much larger pressure and temperature) (Latil e.a. 2008). The purpose of this thesis is to examine if the technique can be used for enhanced recovery. In enhanced oil and gas recovery, water is injected into the reservoir, to increase pressure and replace the gas and/or oil, and thus get more hydrocarbon out of the reservoir. When this is done in a zone of dual permeability, it only works to a certain degree. Suppose we have two layers with different permeabilities, and water is injected; the water replaces the hydrocarbons in the most permeable layer, and fills it up. When more water is injected, the oil in the least permeable layer is harder to push out than the previously injected water in the other layer, and the ‘new’ water just replaces the ‘old’, thus eliminating further effect of water injection. A possible solution for this problem, and subject of this thesis is ‘specific grouting’ of just the high permeable zone, so that the oil in the low permeable zone becomes ‘first choice’; that is, the high permeable layer now has the lowest permeability (because of the cement), and the previously low permeable layer now has the higher permeability of the system. Upon injection, it is now easier for the water to push out and replace the oil than to fill up the other, water saturated low permeable layer. Most important parts of the work for this thesis were designing the laboratory set-up, calculating the concentrations of flushing fluid and measuring pressure drop before and after cementation, so that difference in permeability can be detected.","cementation; permeability; dual; bacteria; enzyme","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Petroleum Engineering","","","",""

This paper aims at finding the amount of power transferred, the losses and efficiency for a given configuration. First, an analytical model is constructed. This analytical model involves equations governing the mechanism of IPT. Second, the paper deals with experimental validation of the derived analytical model.

By looking into two well-known overtopping design guidelines for overtopping, namely, Owen and Eurotop, this report aims to look at the differences it would make in designing a breakwater with either an impermeable or a permeable crest. This is done by building a breakwater model in a wave flume and comparing it with the existing guidelines and assessing the changes that best represent the modified model. It is also important to observe how this physical modification of the crest affects the overtopping discharges and spatial overtopping intensities behind the crest of the breakwater. This will be relevant for designers or contractors tasked to make changes to an existing breakwater that results in its crest becoming impermeable. An insight into the overtopping discharges and intensities will be extremely useful to be able to predict the overall changes and cater for them.","overtopping; breakwater; permeability; porosity; waves","en","student report","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","","",""

(mentor); Verhaege, R.J. (mentor); Baggen, J.H. (mentor)","2010","The growth in sea shipping trade of containerized cargo has surpassed the growth in world trade generally and world economic growth due to the introduction of the container during the 1950s, and the volumes of containerized cargo are still growing rapidly. Most of the ports located in the Hamburg-Le Havre range are fighting for the vastly mounting amounts of containerized cargo. Short of seaport/terminal capacity for supporting the increasing container throughput to the hinterlands is under great pressure both on the short-term and long-term competition between the seaports, with respect to future growth. Several studies have been done according to port competition in Hamburg- Le Havre (HLH) region, for example, in the report ‘Dynamic Port Planning under Competition’ by W.A. Gerrits, a port competition theory and model according to maritime economic has been established to find out the key factors affect the competitiveness for both Rotterdam Port and Antwerp Port. In S. Minderhoud’s report ‘Model Competition for Container Linear Services between the Ports of Rotterdam and Antwerp’, similarly a completion model is built and some strategic suggestions on the policy side are given out. But both of these studies focus on the maritime side or look upon the hinterland part quite generally by applying a cost model. In this research also competition model is built up but having two models base on the transport cost and transport time respectively, and this study is mainly fasten on and go to detail the inland shipping side. The overall objective of this thesis is to build a competition model for inland shipping between the Ports of Rotterdam and Antwerp, and analysis the effects of each model component with the model outputs, and then think it over how to improve Rotterdam or Antwerp’s competitiveness (i.e. market share) on inland shipping market. This model can also be used for policy makers to verify the correctness and effectiveness of decision-makings in regards to port or route strategies. The new model can be implemented to estimate container throughputs on each route in the specific study area and market share as regards the attractiveness for ports of Rotterdam and Antwerp, both on the outgoing and incoming sides. When considering either the travel time or the travel cost on each route for a container, not only the time or costs elements on the inland side need to be included, but also consider some key elements with respect to the maritime seaports conditions. Different outputs can be analyzed in terms of changing some elements to reveal their impacts. Then the relative measures and strategies base on the sensitivity analysis can be planed for improving the market share for either of the two seaports in particular. For building models the methodology of ‘discrete choice model’ is used to model the containers assignment: the shipping companies choose the logistic chain and the associated port based on the utility on each chain. A main variable for the time utility is the generalized transport time and for the cost utility is the generalized transport cost on the specific route. In the time model, the following input elements are included: access time, sea vessel handling time, seaport dwelling time, inland barge handling time, free on-route transport time, locking time. The composing components of cost model, including the access cost, handling costs, seaport time costs (vessel handling, seaport dwelling time), on-route transport cost (incl. labor cost, materials cost, maintenance cost and fuel cost). In the scenarios study, four scenarios are formed, port expansion (scenario 1) and Albert canal improvement (scenario 4) are policy driven measures that are already under execution or under planning, port crane improvement (scenario 2) and using more large barges (scenario 3) are two scenarios base on trends that is going on right now and maintain this trends in the near future. Under each scenario, mostly three options are studied and compared like the ‘What If’ approach. For example, in scenario 1, option 1 will analysis the effects of expansion project Maasvlakte II at Rotterdam port and Antwerp does not expand, Rotterdam will gain more inland shipping market share (and option 2 is a situation Antwerp expands only), however, in option 3 if Antwerp port also does the port expansion with similar size or more, then what is the new balance is analyzed and compared with the current situation. In the end, the conclusions of the research and the limitations of research scope, model (data) and scenarios study are explained. And topics and improvements recommended for further potential studies in the field of inland shipping modeling are concluded as below, - To be a more extensive scope and more systematic study. More seaports and inland ports in the HLH range could be included and modeled, and further studies may also take the other transit goods (i.e. bulk, box) in to consideration. - Models to be more concise and better meeting with the real situation. More components like port dues, barge waiting time at seaport that would contribute to the total cost and time could be also included. Besides, more accurate data are required, especially for barge category compositions on each route, and also try to contain the smaller barges like categories I, II and III. Furthermore, using more recent years of throughputs on the four routes is advised. All these improvements can make the model more reliable trustworthiness. - In the scenarios study, due to the time limitation for this research, actually more measures or combinations of measures could be compared and looked into detail.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Transport, Infrastructure and Logistics","","","",""

The purpose of this research is because the Balearic Islands’ autonomous region is a subnational entity in the early phase of building a SDI. The archipelago is taking its first SDI steps and affronting the challenges that this supposes. Considering the IDEC won the eSDINet+ 2009 best practice award and because of the cultural and physical closeness the IDEC is considered the best SDI node from which the Balearic Islands SDI nodes could benefit from. However, there is also the danger of just copying the IDEC case. Further, there’s consideration of the uniqueness of each case study. Besides, it’s known the experience of one case leads to dilemmas because the nature of assessing SDIs is nontrivial. Therefore, during the research, there’s been consideration about the non-trivial aspects of the SDI assessment. The three important features considered in the non-trivial issue of SDIs are: ambiguity, multi-faceted nature and non-trivial SDI assessment with the need to cope with risk. The case study investigation method was performed for three reasons. First, to learn about the organisational status. Second, to answer “how” and “why” questions. And, third, it is an appropriate way to research the sub-national SDIs in the Balearic Islands and Catalonia. The responsibilities of all the case studies are to make the spatial information accessible for all the users. Then, the roles of all the case studies are public information distribution, link from IDEE to their node and participant in the IDEE. Among other organisation aspects the triangular organisational structure and the maturity matrix were investigated and analysed. Through the surveys it was found out there are various similarities and differences between the Balearic Islands’ and the Catalan triangular organisation structure and other organisational aspects. The IDEC, created in 2001, and the IDEIB, that began in 2007, are at the network GII stage and at the “internetwork” stage, respectively. Both have a similar triangular organisation structure based on their responsibilities. Further IDEmallorca, which started in 2008, is at the intermediary GII stage, and IDEmenorca, which also began in 2008, is at the exchange GII stage. Besides, both follow a similar triangular organisation pattern. After performing a SWOT analysis of the cases studies based on the eSDI-Net+ indicators and the survey answers it is possible to affirm the Balearic Islands SDI nodes have a series of common strengths. These common strengths are: enable value adding services, existing Geoportal and view services, openness with data services (WMS), processes to assess SDI use and user satisfaction, service performance measurements, training provided to staff, legal status of the SDI node organisations and SDI related documentation in Catalan. Then, the weaknesses that all the Balearic Islands SDI nodes need to solve, according to this research, are the lack of strategy and technology and data problems. Also, the IDEmallorca and the IDEmenorca need to solve the following constraints: lack of support of the Councils to the SDI node, inadequate resources and insufficient awareness, poor perception and lack of commitment. To solve these constraints the Balearic Islands SDIs can benefit from the experiences and developments of the IDEC. These experiences and developments are thirteen: learn from other experiences; importance of encouraging local entities; coordination and collaboration between the regional and local entities; sectorial approach; support of the SDI in the organisation; raise awareness on SDI benefits; more partnerships; digital information available; focus on end-users; system engineering point of view; consider project environment; eGovernment funding; total investment paid back in 6 months.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","OTB Research Institute for the Built Environment","GIS Technology","","","",""

(mentor)","2010","In the world of high performance sailing people are using state of the art technology to push the limits in speed and performance. The introduction of the sport kitesurfing has shown the power that kites can generate. It has meant a revolution in the world of surfing. Kitesurfing only exists since 15 years and began to expand around the world only since the year 2000. Already in 2008 the 50 knots speed sailing barrier has been broken by a kite surfer being the first sailing system to do so. This is less than ten years after the sport started to become public in the world. This illustrates the potential in performance for the use of kites.Kites also offer the possibility of a revolution in other fields like sailing where systems are currently developed to provide propulsion for commercial vessels to save fossil fuels. Kite systems are also developed for clean energy production where wind energy at high altitude is harvested. These High Altitude Wind Power systems can also be applied to ships offering the possibility of sailing at a course of 0 degrees into the wind on pure wind energy. In this research the kite system is evolved such that the performance and safety is increased for kitesailing and energy production.","maneuvers; kites; sailing; sail area; performance; speed","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","Aerospace for Sustainable Engineering and Technology","","","",""
