(mentor); Cunningham, S. (mentor); Van Beers, C. (mentor)","2014","The transition to services is analyzed for the downstream activities of the West-European automotive industry. The research builds upon theory on the transition to product related services. The value system of the automotive industry is identified as a value network for the downstream activities. A multiple case study research design is used by investigating an OEM (BMW) and three fleet management companies (Athlon, Alphabet and LeasePlan). The interview data was coded and analyzed using ATLAS TI. The data was analyzed by mapping network views and co-occurrence tables. The economic trend of differentiation into services is found to be highly relevant and is considered central to the structural changes in the downstream activities of the automotive industry. The growing needs of customers related to mobility bring challenges as well as opportunities for OEMs and fleet management companies. Following the data analysis, the changes in the value creation structure today are based on transitions in the core business, technological developments and a changing customer behavior (from car ownership to car usage). These transitions are mainly driven by a trend of urbanization and changing customer needs of the next generation (generation Y). These transitions have a significant impact on the future landscape of the automotive industry. Value will increasingly be added by actors in the downstream activities of the automotive industry through differentiation into services (e.g. MaaS and PaaS). The value structure becomes more networked, due to increased cooperation with strategic partners. This results in an extended networked automotive value system.","automotive industry; value networks; services; extended products; PSS; transitions","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Technology, Policy and Management","Technology, Strategy and Entrepreneurship","","Management of Technology","",""

(mentor)","2014","Query optimization has played a vital role in database research since the 1970’s and up till now. In the relational context, a prerequisite to query optimization is the study of equivalences over relational algebra expressions. Sophisticated techniques for query transformations for traditional query languages include rewriting based optimizations. Rewriting optimization transforms a query into equivalent one and can have a significant impact on execution time. Though RDF Gears is an inspiration to this work, we aim to develop rewriting based optimization strategies that can be applied to similar query languages like PigLatin and Hive. We study the various rewriting based optimizations that currently exist and identify many of the existing ideas that can be extrapolated and applied to RDF Gears. We define the syntax and semantics of Nested Relational Algebra(NRA) and Nested Relational Calculus(NRC) and use a mapping between them to transform expressions of one to the other. We come up with a full set of NRA & NRC, an exhaustive list of rewrite rules, which cover all possible rewrites needed for our language. We mathematically find a minimum core set, that we call the concise or the non-derivable set of NRA & NRC and prove their derivability either mathematically or using a theorem prover. We also present a mathematical proof for equivalence relationship between the rule sets of NRA & NRC. The proof obtained for NRA & NRC that is comprised of basic values, pairs and tuples, for one free variable.","Nested Relational Calculus; Nested Relational Algebra; RDF gears; database","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2014-03-23","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Software Technology","","Computer Science","",""

(mentor); Anton, G. (mentor); Hornegger, J. (mentor)","2014","Dark-field signals are dependent on local orientations and are sensitive to small structural variations in objects. Grating-based X-ray dark-field imaging is a novel technique for gaining image contrast for object structures at size scales below setup resolution. Consequently, dark-field imaging produces images with superior contrast for weak absorption objects and reveals morphological information, leading it particularly beneficial for medical imaging and non-destructive testing. However, up to now algorithms for fully recovering the orientation dependence in a tomographic volume are still unexplored. In this thesis, we propose a new reconstruction method for grating-based X-ray dark-field tomography. The presented algorithm is based on the formula in which an orientation-dependent signal is taken as an additional observable from a standard tomographic scan. The gradient descent method with zero constraints is the solution to the inverse problem. In detail, we extend the tomographic volume to a tensorial set of voxel data, containing the local orientation and contributions to dark-field scattering. The presented algorithm is experimentally verified with a well-defined phantom, a fibrous wooden sample, a carbon fiber reinforced carbon (CFRC) sample, a dried peanut with an opening on its shell and a cotton fiber sample. In our experiments we present the first results of several test specimen exhibiting a heterogeneous composition in micro-structure, which demonstrates the diagnostic potential of the new method.

An experiment was performed along with analog observations to determine how people behaved and reacted to manipulating, cooking, and tasting different insect dishes. A memory-work session was conducted to discover the symbolic role of insects. Subsequently, a vision for a future context and design was proposed, and finally a concept was developed: The Hive restaurant. The concept tries to alternate between positive and negative emotions and to divert the attention away from the insects, to eventually create anticipation and curiosity, which in their turn will create an experience and environment that will encourage insect consumption.","entomophagy; insect eating; emotions; experience","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Industrial Design","","Master of Science Design for Interaction","",""

An experimental study (1.32X105 &lt; Re &lt; 5.30X105) is conducted in an open-jet low turbulence wind tunnel using NACA 0018 airfoil (c = 0.20m) with modified TE. The acoustic emission in the far field is recorded using far-field microphones whereas the developing field near the TE is studied using Time resolved planar particle image velocimetry and oil flow visualization techniques. Study showed the serration-3 (2h = 20mm, λ = 10mm) has maximum tonal noise attenuation and effect the point of separation of laminar separation bubble. The span-wise change in flow characteristics in case of serrations can be attributed to the effective chord-length of the wing at each span-wise position. Further span-wise correlation of chord-wise flow fluctuations show the flow being turbulent upstream of serration-3 TE modification.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

Analysis of fMRI data is one of the venues in which this objective is being pursued. However data produced using fMRI technology is highly complex. To this end, machine learning becomes relevant. Prominent hurdles facing fMRI data analysis are their high-dimensionality (thousands of features per instance), low signal-to-noise ratio and interdependency. This motivates the use of feature selection methods in order to consolidate relevant information and discard noise. Many feature selection methods exist but only a few have been applied in the fMRI domain. In this paper we identify positive characteristics of feature selection algorithms that are beneficial when dealing with fMRI datasets. To do this, we evaluate representatives from each of the three main feature selection classes: Filters, wrappers and embedded methods. We have found probabilistic embedded methods to be the most suitable for fMRI data. We would therefore recommend using these (or similar) methods to process data with fMRI-like characteristics.

(mentor); Diehl, J.C. (mentor)","2014","This graduation thesis focuses on examining the possibilities of developing a mix your own (MYO) concept, as part of a project initiated by FrieslandCampina. FrieslandCampina developed a new route to market, focusing on teenagers and young adults in the emerging middle class of Southeast Asia. The new route to market consists of a dairy-based fruit-flavored beverage, sold using a mobile trolley. A future goal is the development of a MYO concept in which the consumer can create his or her own beverage by using a smartphone, and order it at the trolley. The goal of this thesis is to get to a basic concept description of the MYO application. From here a project planning is described, followed by a roadmap which gives first insights in possible future developments of the application, after implementation. In July 2014, the first test market for the trolley is going to be launched in Ho Chi Minh (Vietnam). In Vietnam, smartphone and internet penetration is rising, and it is estimated that around 2016, 70% of the target group is in possession of a smartphone. These expanding technological possibilities push the virtual life of teenagers and young adults to the extent of where on- and offline experiences merge. This development is exactly what the complete concept, trolley and application, wants to address. To create a first prototype of the application, a generative session was organized, involving two interaction designers and the project manager from FrieslandCampina. This prototype was developed to be used as stimulus material for multiple consumer focus groups. Next to the development of the stimulus material, a questionnaire was held which focused on retrieving valuable information on smartphone penetration and use of the target group. The main insights were that 50% of the target group is in possession of a smartphone, of which 30% has constant access to the internet, and almost everyone from the target group has daily access to the internet. To gain a better understanding of the target group and product features that should be included in the concept, consumer focus groups were conducted in Ho Chi Minh City together with thorough observations. For the target group, habits like eating and drinking out are very well embedded in their daily lives, which shows the enormous potential of the concept. The result of the focus groups was a set of features that were perceived as very interesting. These features together form the basis of the first version of the MYO application. This includes a part in which the consumer can mix their own drink, based on selecting a flavour and strength of this flavour, selecting the amount of foaming and selecting a topping. Next to that, the possibility to share your creation on social media is something that seem to be highly valued by the target group. Also loyalty and saving programs seems to resonate with the target group, next to the possibility to locate the trolley by using the application. Main insight concerning the value of the MYO application for FrieslandCampina is that the concept shows to be a volume driver, consumers mentioned it to be the reason for repeated purchase. Furthermore, a higher (mostly daily) purchase intention compared to the concept without the application is mentioned by most groups. The use of an application gives FrieslandCampina the possibility to collect valuable consumer data. This consumer data can be used to improve the front- and back-end of the concept over time, and has become a big part of the roadmap content. The front-end can be improved by adjusting the application to the preferences of different consumer groups, based on similarities between customers that have used the system previously. The back-end can be improved by directly implementing the data gathered by the application and trolley in the Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) in order to develop a responsive supply chain which reacts better on fluctuations in demand. To achieve the above, three main topics need to be integrated in the organization of FrieslandCampina: managing the content management system of the application, integrating the consumer data in front-end and back-end of the concept and analyzing real time consumer behavior through social media. These topics are integrated in a project planning, which shows the basic steps during development of the application, to get to implementation. The main goal of the roadmap is for the concept to become embedded in the daily life of the target group. The roadmap consists of four basic steps, of which the first is the launch of the basic application. The second to fourth step are based on new information gathered in time, described below. The second step, extending the product by improving preferred features and personalizing the application per user group, can be taken if similarities based on demographic customer data are mapped and user groups are defined. Through social media, activities of consumers are monitored, and insights are gathered on online behavior, resulting in a deep understanding on community behavior concerning the MYO concept. This can be used for the third step, which focuses on building a strong on- and offline community. Combined mapped consumer data and social media behavior insights result in know-how on how to engage the consumer in a sympathetic way. This can be used to engage in time and place bound conversation with the target group, the last step of the roadmap. By implementing the basic application developed during this project, and develop the organization in a way the roadmap can be carried out as planned, embedding the MYO application and trolley concept in the daily lives of the target group will have a higher chance of becoming a commercial success. Furthermore, it can function as a first pilot in which real time consumer data is used to improve products and businesses. For FrieslandCampina to create more products like this and focus more on generating and analyzing consumer generated content on social media can be part of their future digital strategy and can improve profit over al business segments.","FrieslandCampina; Mix Your Own Drink Application; Roadmap; Digital Strategy; Smartphone; Vietnam; Southeast Asia","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","2015-03-28","Industrial Design Engineering","Strategic Product Design","","","",""

(mentor); Ruiter, I.A. (mentor); Schorsch, J.F. (mentor)","2014","The topic of this graduation project is to “Design an arm support for a powered exoskeleton to help caregivers lift disabled clients”. It is connected to a PhD project on the Faculty of 3me in TU Delft, which aims to develop an exoskeleton for the caregiving industry. The idea is to decrease the physical and psychological stress caregivers experience when lifting and manipulating with their clients, while speeding up the caregiving process. A research was conducted, which looked at the work currently done by caregivers and the state and needs of their clients. A market research looked at the devices currently in use in the caregiving industry and a technology research examined existing exoskeletons, built for various purposes (from rehabilitation to military). A special attention was given to ergonomics of lifting with the envisioned exoskeleton as well as anthropometrics of human arms. Several concepts were developed through ideation, which all propose a form factor for the exoskeleton arm support. The most suitable concept was selected as the final concept through expert evaluation and mockup testing. In the embodiment phase, only the lower arm support was detailed in order to narrow down the scope of the project, which proved to be too wide for such a short project. Through detailing a producible design proposal was developed. A prototype of the lower arm support was built and tested with subjects, which included caregivers and naive subjects. Aesthetics, Ergonomics and Usability were looked at. It was concluded that an effective lower arm support was developed, which solves the majority of the challenges imposed by the Project Assignment and additional findings from the Analysis phase. The design proposal is not without flaws and additional work is needed to finalize the arm support to its final form, which will be able to be used in the caregiving environment. The challenges and proposed courses were determined and presented as future recommendations for the project.","exoskeleton; caregiving; care; elderly; disabled; lifting","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Design Engineering","","Master of Science Integrated Product Design","",""

Resources such as books and software exist to train students in their knowledge of the human body. Most books focus on specific parts of the body or try to give a general overview. Images in books present the information from a single view point, since interaction is not possible. Several software tools have been developed to illustrate anatomy. The aims of these tools are diverse, including education, anatomical research, surgical training and pre-operative planning. In this work, we introduce the Online Anatomical Human, an online anatomy browser and annotation system that incorporates medical image data in 2D and linked 3D views. We created a system that is available to everyone and as portable as possible. The application functions as an educational tool where users can not only retrieve, but also add and share information. Our main contribution is that this system is the first of its kind to offer real anatomical data in an online environment with existing linked knowledge and the possibility to add new information. We describe this data as real anatomical data, because it is obtained from medical imaging data and is not based on an idealized average anatomy. Besides tools for exploration of the data, an editor is available for annotations. These annotations can be added to the 3D mesh directly. This information can be used to enrich the model. Since the system runs completely inside a web browser, no installation is required and no data has to be permanently stored on the local machine.","human anatomy; medical visualization; WebGL; annotations; leap motion","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Computer Graphics","","Medical Visualization","",""

The envelope approach, where the problem instance is directly reduced to a flexible solution and the `solve and robustify' approach, where a fixed inflexible schedule is created and then relaxed to create a flexible schedule. Using state of the art flexibility metrics and Interval Schedules we show that the envelope approach, which has been considered the weaker approach in recent literature, can be greatly improved. By using Interval Schedules to remove temporal interaction between tasks we were able to estimate resource violations much more accurately, improving the flexibility of the resulting schedules.","scheduling; project scheduling; Precedence Constraint Posting; flexibility; Resource Constraint Project Scheduling Problem; RCPSP; NedTrain","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2014-03-26","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Software Technology","","Algorithmics","",""

(mentor); Wichman, B.G.H.M. (mentor); Houben, L.J.M. (mentor); Verhagen, H.J. (mentor)","2014","Nowadays, in the Netherlands there are about 600 kilometers of asphaltic revetments lying mainly on sea dikes of which approximately 400 km of dike is covered with asphalt concrete [STOWA, 2011]. Asphalt concrete revetments are applied the most and are mostly of older age. Because of the older age it needs intensive care involving periodic inspection and safety checks. The focus on maintenance has encouraged for research to be done on asphalt revetments. The (fatigue) behavior of asphalt concrete on a sand foundation under wave loading is not very well known. Especially about the interaction between an asphalt concrete revetment and the subsoil under wave attack only limited knowledge is available. In this study the focus is placed on getting more detailed insight into the interaction between an asphalt concrete revetment and the underlying subsoil (foundation) under wave loading for both old and newly made asphalt concrete. Deltares and KOAC-NPC have been focusing on the interaction between an asphalt revetment and the subsoil under wave attack and have been performing experiments together with finite element calculations to predict and validate their data. Medium scale experiments which simulate a loading caused by wave attack on a scaled part (about a factor 3) of an asphalt concrete dike revetment were designed. A series of short pulse (haversine) loadings were applied to simulate the stresses and strains during wave attack. In total six medium scale experiments (4 on newly made and 2 on old asphalt concrete) have been carried out and after each of the experiments the test set-up and/or procedure had been improved. The medium scale experiments almost resemble a falling weight deflection measurement. With the deflections measured during the experiments the occurring strains can be calculated. Using the WESLEA software the elastic deflection profile for a selection of pulse loadings measured during the experiments are back-calculated for selected measurement points of experiments 3, 4, 5 and 6. The linear elastic calculations with the WESLEA software led to a better understanding of the behavior of the asphalt concrete plate on the Baskarp sand for both the old and new asphalt concrete. Back-calculations for all of the loading stages during experiment 5 on old asphalt concrete with the ABAQUS model used by Deltares and KOAC-NPC have been performed, using a linear elastic material model for both the asphalt concrete plate and the Baskarp sand bed. The fits are reasonable, but a low stiffness modulus is found for the asphalt concrete. From the back-calculations of the medium scale experiments with WESLEA, typical stiffness moduli for the Baskarp sand bed (varying between 40 to 60 MPa) are found, depending on the loading conditions. These values are also sufficient for the linear elastic calculations with ABAQUS model for experiment 5. A constant stiffness modulus of the asphalt concrete could not be determined. It is observed that the stiffness modulus is different for each load magnitude, even for the same asphalt concrete plate on the same Baskarp sand bed. The stiffness modulus of the asphalt concrete plate depends on the strain level and the loading speed [KOAC-NPC, 2013]. The uncertainty of the back-calculated asphalt concrete stiffness modulus also depends on the varying thickness of the asphalt concrete plate and the accuracy of the measured elastic deformations. Since most of the current asphalt concrete revetments in the Netherlands consist of aged asphalt concrete (about 90% is older than 20 years), the failure mechanism most likely to occur under wave impacts is failure due to fatigue. From the research done up till now, it has become clear that if the asphalt concrete revetments which are less affected by ageing are less vulnerable to failure due to fatigue under wave impacts.","fatigue; interaction between asphalt concrete and sand; asphalt concrete revetment; medium scale experiments; wave impact; Baskarp sand; deflection profile","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","","",""

This thesis focusses on the design of low noise amplifier (LNA) and square law detector meant for realizing a 60 GHz RF-front end for passive radiometer application using 0.25 ?m BiCMOS technology. The design details of the LNA including the influence of layout parasitic are described. In particular, a detailed discussion on the LNA layout at 60 GHz and the need for electromagnetic (EM) verification simulation is presented. To this end, a design procedure of LNA is presented which takes into account the layout parasitics at the early stages of the design. Two LNA designs are discussed. The first LNA is designed to drive the detector input impedance and the second one is designed with a tapped capacitive transformer for output matching. The LNA driving the detector impedance achieves a post layout simulation gain of 21.3 dB of gain, 4.8 dB of noise figure at 63 GHz while the LNA designed for output matching achieves 19.6 dB and a noise figure of 4.8 dB at 63 GHz. The design of square law detectors using standard bipolar configurations is also presented in this thesis and are benchmarked for performance in terms of the detector specifications.","LNA; Square Law Detector; 60 GHz; SiGe","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2014-04-01","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Microelectronics & Computer Engineering","","Microelectronics","",""

In medical imaging this is used to combine and compare images from patients in order to find abnormalities or to track a patient’s treatment effects over time. There are registration algorithms and software packages available, but they are cumbersome and hard to use, making image registration a non-trivial and time consuming task. 2D visualization techniques are often used for visualizing 3D datasets and the results of the registration. This is a problem because one dimension is discarded that could give insight in the relative positioning of the datasets. REGISTRATIONSHOP was developed to improve and simplify the process of volume registra- tion with 3D visualizations and simple interactive tools. REGISTRATIONSHOP provides ways of creating basic visualizations of 3D volumetric data. Interactive rigid and non-rigid transformation tools can be used to manipulate the volumes. REGISTRATIONSHOP provides immediate visual feedback for all the rigid transformation tools. A novel 3D comparative visualization technique is introduced as well as a new way of placing landmarks in volumes.

(mentor); Bergema, C.P.M.A. (mentor)","2014","As a result of rising operational costs, economic uncertainties and fierce competition KLM is pressurized on their European network. The ‘all-fits-one’ approach KLM precedes is no longer viable seen from an economic and customer point of view. Customer demand increased value for money, while KLM tries to further optimize its current way of thinking. Inflight catering is one of the services to illustrate the only option is either to take or not to take the product. Customers are critical, expect a personal approach and demand high value for money. Personalization in service providing is a growing trend in other industries, but has so far not been applied on large scale in the aviation industry. Great opportunity lies ahead to differentiate with. Framed upon a profound study including an internal and external analysis, staff and pax interviews, process analysis, and a creative session, ten problem factors were found illustrating the overall problem to be larger than catering alone. The actual problem is framed in both customer perception and KLM’s service approach, illustrating the ‘all-fits-one’ model to be obsolete for the masses of short haul travellers. The problem factors supporting this statement were transformed in a solution ground named the future trilogy. The future trilogy holds three pillars entailing; the experience economy, choice and control and corporate social responsibility, supporting a future vision on how to direct the trilogy. ‘’KLM SHOULD GIVE MEANING TO THEIR VALUE PROPOSITION BY ALLOWING CUSTOMERS TO HAVE CHOICE IN SERVICE PREFERENCES AND CONTROL ON THEIR TRAVEL, RESULTING IN A TRANSPARENT VALUE PROPOSITION A BETTER BRAND EXPERIENCE AND A REDUCTION OF OPERATIONAL WASTE’’ All customers travelling have different preferences. KLM should therefore enable customers to allow what includes the ticket price, be it a sandwich, a paper or luggage. A new model is suggested that includes issuing award-miles in the ticket price to purchase services with, in order to freeform a customer’s travel. The ‘virtual’ award-miles issued during booking stage can either be used to purchase services with (luggage, upgrades, catering, etc.) and or be stored for later travels with KLM. This model allows customers to freeform their travel, as it turn the Flying Blue program into a loyalty program instead of a frequent flyer program. The model enables the ending of KLM’s ‘all-fits-one’ service inefficient model, as well embracing unbundling in customer participating manner. The implementation of the model will change the second stage of the booking process, allowing customers to shape their service preferences. Five profile suggestions are made to display the function of the adapted booking process. Three profiles; shape new travel, previous travel and my preferred refer to the customer ability to determine what they want themselves. The other two suggested profiles; the green traveller and royal treatment are used to boost ancillary sales or to stimulate certain customer behaviour. Based upon on the model the overall benefits are displayed, for both customer and company, directing to a global overview of projects to be initiated enabling the model to be functioning. Subsequently this is framed into a roadmap, leading to 2020.","design; strategy; personalisation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Product Innovation Management","","","",""

(mentor); Rafik, K. (mentor)","2014","The offshore wind industry is growing fast with an average annual market growth rate of almost 7% in the next five years. Service of wind turbines has proven to be expensive and difficult, especially offshore. A well-coordinated support organisation, optimized logistic and maintenance strategies are required to effectively reduce the costs associated with wind farm support. The thesis work focuses on developing a stochastic time based Logistic and Service model to analyse wind farm maintenance and logistic support organisation. The primary objective is to obtain the most cost-effective strategy, besides improving the availability of the wind farm. Within the scope of project, the wind turbine technology and the causes of its failures are reviewed. From the sub-assembly components, a list of critical spare parts is short-listed. As part of the data analysis and field studies, reliability patterns of the wind turbines are obtained from the Fraunhofer IWES WMEP database. The spare part support organisation is based on two running wind farms, namely Nysted and OWEZ. The weather information provided by the FINO 1 and FINO 2 MET masts are employed to estimate the accessibility to the wind farm. Further, based on the classification of the maintenance type of spare parts, the logistic and service strategies are implemented. The optimization of logistic and service model has been done separately, where the best possible values of ordering parameters and service aspects like finding the right access vessel strategy, the crew strength, the shift patterns, the feasibility of an offshore accommodation or renting of huge ships like mother vessel are explored. To verify the working of the model, sensitivity analysis, comparison studies and extreme value testing are performed. The model is able to predict a suitable strategy for a given wind farm, which is shown by implementing the model for a planned wind farm. With the developed O&M model, accurate inventory stocks, downtime, availability, service and logistic parameters and hence the inventory and maintenance cost is obtained. The results from the reference farms are encouraging as different strategies are compared for a cost-effective solution.","Windenergy","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","Aerodynamics, Wind Energy & Propulsion","","","",""

(mentor); Braam, C.R. (mentor); Hoogenboom, P.C.J. (mentor); Middelkoop, F.H. (mentor)","2014","This study deals with the finite element analysis to determine the behavior of reinforced concrete beams and high walls. It is assumed that the behavior of these members can be described by a plane stress field. This thesis consists of two major parts. The first part is about reinforcing of slender beams with the Linear Elastic Finite Element Method (LE-FEM). The aim is to determine whether LE-FEM is able to provide safe and reliable reinforcement designs for slender beam specimens. In this thesis a new method of reinforcement design with the Scia Engineer 2D Finite Element (FE) module is developed. This new method is called the ‘step by step method’ or SSM. Capacity checks in accordance with the Eurocode are done with the help of the Scia 1D beam model. The nonlinear analysis of the specimens is done with the help of the NLE-FEM package called ATENA. This software can simulate the actual behavior of the concrete elements inclusive cracking and plasticity/yielding phases. A nonlinear analysis is set as the reference point for the actual behavior of the specimens and is validated by using laboratory research carried out by Van Hulten in 2010. Two main conclusions are drawn from the comparison of the linear elastic analysis and nonlinear analysis. First, the ‘step by step’ method of reinforcement design resolved the problem which was reported by Romans. He reported (2010) that, crack width criterion for the bottom of the cross section of the slender beams when the normal design method is used in Linear elastic finite element method does not satisfy the crack width criterion according to Eurocode. The second conclusion is that in the serviceability limit state, the LE-FEM cannot meet the Eurocode crack criterion requirements for most of the specimens due to large cracks in the web of the cross-section. It is found that shear reinforcement has a major effect on the control of cracking in the serviceability limit state in the web of the cross section. One possible solution is a combination of skin reinforcement with extra shear reinforcement. In this thesis this combination is introduced in three different categories, each with a different reinforcement ratio of the slender beam specimens. Their results in terms of ultimate and serviceability limit state (ULS and SLS) are presented as well. The second part of this thesis is about deep beams. In addition to slender beams, deep beam specimens will be examined as well. Deep beam specimens with span-depth ratios (a/d) smaller or bigger than 1 are investigated. Different reinforcement configurations are made using the following four analysis methods: standard beam method (SBM), the ‘strut-and-tie’ method (STM), the LE-FEM (Scia Engineer) and the NL-FEM (Scia Engineer). As in the first phase for slender beams, ATENA functions as a reference point. An evaluation procedure is carried out in order to properly model with ATENA. The conclusion is that for deep beam specimens with an a/d ratio of less than 1, all different reinforcing methods give satisfying results in SLS and ULS. However, the most efficient method that uses fewer reinforcements is the method based on NL-FEM (Scia Engineer) and STM. For deep beam specimens with an a/d ratio of more than 1 but still within the range of deep beams, the crack width criterion does not satisfy in the web of the cross-section. This problem is solved by doubling the amount of longitudinal mesh net at the bottom half of the cross-sectional area.

(mentor)","2014","In the near future, human cell based Organ-on-Chip models are likely to replace animal experimentation during the development of new drugs. Not only is animal testing associated with ethical issues, but human cell based models can also give a more accurate representation of the human physiology, resulting in more reliable results of drug screening experiments. Furthermore, high-throughput drug screening is made possible by real-time readout of cell activity, using electrodes or other forms of cellular readout. Additionally, the high costs of drug development will be reduced, especially if the new devices will be suitable for mass production. To be able to accurately model the human physiology, the device must be fabricated using biocompatible materials, often polymers with special requirements like flexibility and stretchability. These materials are in general not standardized in microfabrication cleanroom environments, limiting the current designs suitability for mass production. In this thesis an Organ-on-Chip device was designed, fabricated and validated for use in advanced skin tissue modeling. Without compromising for the requirements imposed by the physiology of skin tissue, the device is designed to be suitable for mass production. A prior model for cardiotoxicity screening, Cytostretch was used as a starting point for the skin model device. The new features added to the design were fabricated by adding certain steps to the manufacturing process, compatible with the current process flow. This modular approach makes the Cytostretch technology flexible and suitable to rapidly adapt the device design for modeling different tissues in the future. In this research, methods were explored for (i) the fabrication of large membranes, (ii) the fabrication of holes with a diameter of 5 to 8 micrometer, and (iii) the deposition of layers on polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS). As a result, large perforated membranes of PDMS were fabricated and a new etching technique for PDMS was developed in order to create the small feature size of maximally 8 micrometer in the membrane. Also, a novel method to prevent thermally induced stress in layers deposited on PDMS is presented. After fabrication of the device, it has been validated to be suitable for skin tissue engineering by culturing human dermal tissue on the device.","Organ-on-Chip; PDMS; Polydimethylsiloxane; Skin tissue model","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Microelectronics","","Microelectrical Engineering","",""

(mentor)","2014","Scour hole formation around offshore monopile foundations is a threat for the structure’s stability. Large uncertainty leads to conservatism in design codes and hence to high construction costs. Under the same hydrodynamic loading as for scour hole formation the soil can liquefy due to structural vibrations or waves. The aim of this study is to determine the effect of liquefaction from vibrations of offshore monopile foundations on scour by performing scaled flume experiments, where liquefaction is induced by a monotonic excess pore water pressure (EPWP). Liquefaction is known to be caused by EPWP build up under cyclic loading and normally lasts for limited time, because the built up pore water pressure drains off to the bed surface. Therefore, monotonic EPWP is introduced at the bottom of a pile, which is placed in a flume filled with fine sand. During the experiments a current is used to induce scour, while the EPWP is used as independent variable. In the experiments the EPWP gradient is observed to take some time to bring the sediment into liquefaction. First the soil is lifted, but as soon as the vertical resistance of the sand is lost a current breaks through. Subsequently, the flow concentrates in one feeder and sediment is transported as if it is in suspension. When this occurs depends on the magnitude of the EPWP. During the scour experiments this resulted in a sudden collapse of the scour hole. The scour depth decreased and a new balance arises between slope sliding and erosion due to the horseshoe and lee-wake vortices. It is concluded that under liquefaction the equilibrium scour depth decreases for a larger negative excess pore water pressure gradient. Furthermore, the angle of repose is decreased. The equalising effect of liquefaction on the scour hole is also expected in field situations, but the extent is unknown. The potential gain of the decreased scour depth to the structure’s stability is limited, since the liquefied area may not be expected to provide any contribution to the stability of the structure.","scour; liquefaction; experiment; monopile; excess pore water pressure","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Structural Engineering","","Structural Mechanics","",""

(mentor); Van de Ven, F.H.M. (mentor); Timmermans, J.S. (mentor)","2014","The Greater New Orleans area suffers from flooding caused by extreme rainfall events on a yearly basis. Since most stormwater is flushed into the drainage system via mostly impervious surface, water does not infiltrate into the ground, which causes subsidence due to soil drying out, which causes damages to roads, buildings and underground utilities. These problems are now being addressed in a comprehensive plan called the Greater New Orleans Urban Water Plan (UWP). The project area consists of the east banks of Orleans and Jefferson Parish and all of St. Bernard Parish. The goals of the UWP are to increase safety, provide economic opportunity, and improve quality of life. The next step is implementation. In literature several constraints are found towards implementation which are usually more socio-institutional rather than technical, such as unclear, fragmented roles and responsibilities of local government and limits of regulatory framework. A study was conducted to identify the next steps for implementation. The framework in which this was done consists of a stakeholder analysis, followed by interviews which gave input for a Strengths-Weaknesses-Opportunities-Threats-analysis (SWOT-analysis), identified constraints towards implementation and gave input for a Multi Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA). The SWOT analysis showed more strengths and opportunities than weaknesses and threats, which shows that overall the interviewed stakeholders are positive about the plan. The biggest strengths of the UWP are considered the approach and principals, the biggest weaknesses is funding and lack of technical data in the plan, the biggest opportunities are in funding and cost savings and the biggest threats are costs, creating enormous expectations for organizations, the potential of mosquito breeding sites and it being too much work for an organization. The weaknesses and threats need to be considered in order to start implementation. The constraints that were identified were put in the framework of the chain model. The chain model is a tool which was developed by a workgroup of the Dutch Ministry of Public Works to develop a new way of policy making, since this policy subjects were becoming more and more complex. The model consists of five elements: policy, legislation, implementation, maintenance and control, and organization. Basically, what the policymakers decide in the first component influences the work of all the stakeholders in the next components. The idea is that different stakeholders from each of these components should be involved from the very beginning to help state what the policy issues are and what causes them. This could require changes to the last component, organization. After identification of the constraints by the stakeholders during the interviews, it became clear that a component was missing from the chain model, namely politics. Since the UWP was not developed by local government, the first step is for local elected officials to buy-in. In each of the components of the chain model constraints were identified. In politics the most mentioned constraint is getting buy-in from general public, which would require a lot of outreach according to the interviewees. A small survey was conducted which revealed that general public had knowledge on the stormwater management and subsidence, but hardly anyone knew about the UWP. Yet, when explaining the principles and strategies of the UWP to them, the overall reaction was quite positive, showing that this is a constraint that might not be that difficult to overcome. In the field of policy and legislation the biggest constraint is the lack of policy and legislation. All three parishes have a comprehensive plan that shows the vision and policy for the future. In Orleans and St. Bernard Parish these plans include a vision that is similar to the UWP. As for legislation, there is hardly anything that incentivizes projects and plans of the UWP. But there are some developments on the way; Orleans Parish is in the process of rewriting their Comprehensive Zoning Ordinance, which now includes an article on stormwater retention in new developments and re-developments and Jefferson Parish is conducting a study towards the reduction of the amount of needed parking lots for new developments, but more can be done and should be done in for example ordinances on roads and building codes. Constraints in implementation can mostly be accounted to not knowing enough about the UWP. The constraints focused on project areas being in areas which are too densely developed, however the UWP does not contain any projects which require buildings and developments to be torn down, or projects being on private land, which is only the case when this is in agreement with the owners of the private land. The biggest constraint with maintenance and control was the possible lack of maintenance, and more importantly, the responsibility of maintenance, which in some cases still needs to be assigned to an entity, organization or person. The component organization had multiple constraints that were frequently mentioned: responsibility of different aspects of the UWP; fragmentation on a local and regional level; coordination; and cooperation and agreement between entities and parishes. These are very important constraints to overcome, since in order to reach the full potential of the Plan it should a regional effort. Funding and paradigm shift where the most frequent mentioned constraints, which can be placed in multiple parts of the chain model, funding in implementation and maintenance and control, and paradigm shift in politics and organization. The ELECTRE III method was used to perform an MCDA for several elements of the UWP on several criteria and the most frequent mentioned constraints. It revealed that there is a difference in what is best to implement, based on the criteria, and what is easiest to implement, based on the constraints. It also showed that it might be rewarding to take a different approach in what to implement in each parish, since the outranking results were different for each parish. In an ideal situation for implementation of the UWP a regional entity would be created which would have responsibility of urban drainage and subsidence in the whole project area. Since this will be difficult to realize, due to entities needing to give up responsibilities and the fact that an extra entity will be added to an already complex organizational structure it might be better to create a board in which each of the entities and parishes participate. Also, currently the most general approach for implementation is a top-down approach, however, since the neighborhoods in the region, especially in Orleans Parish are quite strong, a bottom-up approach should also be considered. However, it should be taken into account that this will only be a good approach for small-scale retrofits, and not for the large scale strategies in the UWP, such as circulation of the canals. Implementation of the UWP will be a big challenge and making additions to the plan, like an action plan for the stakeholders or adding more scientific background, will not be enough, but there are a lot of steps that can be taken. Assigning responsibilities, maybe even changing the jurisdictions of some entities, making policies and legislation that incentivize implementation of the Plan and enforcing this legislation, finding a way to get every stakeholder around the table, which perhaps can be done in the form a board. Communication will be a very important aspect, in the form of outreach to the general public, but also to remove some of the uncertainties that stakeholders have. And finally commitment is needed from local government, commitment by adjusting policies and regulations, but for now starting to implement the proposed demonstration projects.","watermanagement; implementation; New Orleans; socio-Institutional Constraints; ketenmodel; stakeholder analysis; SWOT Analysis; ELECTRE III","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Water Management","","Water Resources Management","",""

(mentor); Van Overloop, P.J.A.T.M. (mentor); Botterhuis, A.A.J. (mentor); Sadowska, A.D. (mentor)","2014","As many areas in The Netherlands are located below or slightly above mean sea level, or adjacent to large rivers, a lot of effort is put into ensuring the Dutch keep dry feet. The prevention of flooding is the most important and internationally well-known layer in the Dutch water safety policy. Nowadays this takes place by means of taking physical measures, i.e. making sure flood defences (e.g. dikes, barriers) are of adequate height and strength, or allowing enough space for the river to store water in case of extreme discharges. Though very robust, taking physical measures for flood prevention is generally also very expensive. Another method to prevent flooding, currently hardly applied in The Netherlands, is anticipatory: the optimization of the control of the large (controllable) flood defence structures in the Dutch water system. This is explored in this thesis in the form of the application of Optimal Control, which utilizes Model Predictive Control. This is the only control method which can deal with large interconnected systems, anticipation on predictions, conflicting goals, and constraints. It is a methodology that originates in the process industries and is throughout the world applied to all sorts of systems and processes. More recently it has found its way into water management. A major benefit of this method is that the costs of realisation, operation and maintenance of such a system are estimated to be orders of magnitude lower than taking (extensive) physical measures. In previous studies the influence of the application of Model Predictive Control on the water safety in The Netherlands has been determined for specific cases. However, a probabilistic analysis, which can provide a more complete picture of the profit of this technology in general, i.e. the effect on overall system behaviour, and is required by Dutch law for any measure in order to be considered a potential solution for safety against flooding, has not been possible thus far. In this research a computing platform which allows for parallel calculation is used which makes this analysis possible. In this research, a model framework has been set up allowing for such a probabilistic water safety analysis of The Netherlands using Model Predictive Control. This framework consists of: - a high resolution Sobek Rural model of the rivers, lakes and estuaries of The Netherlands (LSM) which is used to simulate the real world; - Optimal Control in Matlab, which includes an internal model, an objective function and constraints; - Hydra-Zoet probabilistic model to account for the probabilistic analysis. During this research improvements and adaptations have been made to the models used. Using this framework the probabilistic approach has been followed in order to determine the effect of the application of Model Predictive Control. Additionally five structures, selected considering existing plans for the water system and the effect these structures can have on the water distribution, have been added to these models to further investigate possibilities within the system. The effect of Model Predictive Control in this research is determined largely by a minimization of the objective function which includes many locations, structures and goals, each made explicit by weights set in the controller. Before results could be obtained, an iterative process (trial and error) has been gone through in order to determine a best suiting set of weights to be used for this research. The required model calculations for the probabilistic analysis used in this research consist of a limited set of 108 calculations determined by previous research of HKVLIJN IN WATER, these are considered to be representative for the overall system behaviour. This set consist of nine river discharge levels, combined with six storm levels combined with possible (dependant) failing of the Maeslant barrier and Hartel barrier. What can be concluded from the results is that, when applying Optimal Control, clear effects can be expected in certain cases, while in other cases differences with current control are minimal. As a result, the effect on the overall system behaviour (normative water levels) is minimal as all scenarios are considered and effects are levelled out. In the upper rivers water system no differences can be observed as in this water system (almost) no structures exist to influence the water distribution. When the new structures are added to the model, more extensive differences can be observed. The effects of these structures are clear when considering individual cases, however the results in terms of differences in normative water levels are not in line with results obtained from individual cases. More detailed inspection of the results obtained from different parts in the model framework revealed some inconsistencies in the outcomes of the Sobek-calculations, which are probably the cause of the deviating results in terms of normative water levels. Due to the complexity of the model framework and enormous amount of data output such inconsistencies can be easily overlooked. Considering this the results displayed in this research should not be considered representative for the differences in overall system behaviour when the new structures are added to the system. Possibly some inconsistencies still exist for the calculations with current control and Optimal Control without new structures as well. Recommendations have been made for improvements of the model framework and further research, most importantly the addition of the new structures to the objective function.","Model Predictive Control; probabilistic safety analysis; Dutch delta","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Water Management","","Water Resources Management","",""

Coop-Africa offers people the opportunity to improve their own situation by making bicycles accessible for them. A bicycle allows people to cover a distance four times quicker than on foot; with the help of a bicycle they can transport five times more freight. This allows entrepreneurs to transport their trade in order to make a living, doctors to visit more patients and children to go to school. The project was to find a solution for three detected problems: 1. The quality of the currently available bicycles in Uganda is poor. 2. Although there is a high demand for various types of bicycles, there are mainly big, men’s bicycles on the market. This problem affects especially women and young adults, who do not fit the big bicycles. 3. It is expensive to import bicycles from outside Uganda. A twofold solution has been found: a new frame model is designed especially for African women, and a production plan to be able to set up a series production in Uganda. This production creates work and quality control. Apart from that, less costs have to be spent on import taxes.","industrial production; emerging markets; bicycle design","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Industrial Design","","Master of Science Integrated Product Design","",""

However, as a consequence of observational errors, errors in the mathematical models and discretisation errors in the computational models, our knowledge about what happens in reality is imperfect. The main purpose of the thesis is to investigate whether it is possible to quantify and to reduce the uncertainty of Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) models - more speci_cally the Spalart-Allmaras, Smith's KL and the Launder-Sharma RANS turbulence models - using the Bayesian inference theorem. An underlying objective is to do determine the prior uncertainty by means of the analyst's knowledge of the used model, instead of merely guessing it, and the development of a methodical way to create and verify the correctness of a surrogate model for the RANS models. Inherent to using RANS models is the closure problem resulting from applying the Reynoldsaveraging technique to the Navier-Stokes equations. The model equations that are created (e.g. SA, KL and LS model) to mitigate the closure problem contain coe_cients who's values are determined from calibration with experimental values. It is for some of these so-called closure coe_cients that a prior uncertainty interval is determined.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering | Aerodynamics and Wind Energy","",""

(mentor)","2014","The achievable dynamic performance in high-precision systems by applying light and stiff design principles is reaching its limits. To further increase performance, better insight is needed in the cause and effect of the systems modeshapes and forced vibrations. In this way, transfer functions between actuator/excitation sources and sensor locations/point of interest can be optimized specifically, instead of just pushing for the highest first resonance frequency on system level. The purpose of this study is to enhance the understanding of the dynamic behavior of a structure and to provide methods for improving the dynamic response by applying sensitivity analysis. This is realized by first investigating the existing methods to derive the sensitivity values of structural response functions that characterize the dynamic behavior. With this knowledge on computational methods, the investigation proceeds with a focus on design variables. It is shown that the element-wise design variables can be assembled into a vector. This vector then describes a global design change. By doing so, the number of design variables is effectively decreased without loosing the ability to reach an optimal solution. Reducing both the design space and the solution space has led to the development of an estimation procedure for 1D structures. With this method the required structural change that leads to an intended modeshape modification can be estimated. In three case studies sensitivity analysis was employed in the evaluation of a conceptual design of a mechatronic system. The application of sensitivity analysis in the first case study resulted in a significant improvement for the rejection of floor vibrations. However, it was also shown that such an improvement could not be obtained for a coordinate direction in which a controller is present. In the second and third case study, a method for connecting two components was developed. The method uses the nodal points of one component as connection locations. Combining both the static and dynamic nodal points led to a minimization of the energy transfer between the two. The development of a demonstrator must validate the concept. By studying the sensitivity of the nodal points two tuning parameters were identified, namely force distributions and addition of lumped masses. They created the possibility to show the effect of the optimization that uses the nodal points. Furthermore, the method of tuning for optimal dynamic response could be the next step in mastering dynamic behavior.","sensitivity analysis; passive vibration control","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2015-04-07","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Precision and Microsystems Engineering","","","",""

(mentor); Hofland, B. (mentor); Paarlberg, A.J. (mentor); Smale, A.J. (mentor); Van den Bos, J.P. (mentor)","2014","For the design of granular bed protections often a stability parameter is used. The stability parameter represents the forces that are acting on the stones and is used to predict the response of the bed to these forces. Existing parameters are often derived for a limited range of application. When the parameter is used outside this range, the bed response is not predicted sufficiently accurate. Some of the existing stability parameters are derived to incorporate the effects of turbulence properly. Other researches investigated the influence of the acceleration on the stone stability and derived a parameter from that. But none of the existing stability parameters incorporate both effects together. In this thesis the complex interaction between velocities, turbulence and acceleration is incorporated into one stability parameter. The stability parameter is designed such that it incorporates the effect of turbulence correctly, incorporates the effect of advective acceleration and that can be applied to non-uniform flows. A relation between the proposed stability parameter and the dimensionless entrainment rate is derived. This is done for a wide range of flows and geometries to make the stability parameter as general as possible. There are three unknown constants in the stability parameter. One for the value of the turbulence relative to the velocity, one for value of the acceleration force relative to the quasi-steady forces, and one for the method of determining the acceleration force. These constants are determined with a correlation analysis. The constants that result in the highest correlation between the stability parameter and the dimensionless entrainment rate are chosen. The proposed stability parameter leads to a considerable higher correlation with the bed response than the existing parameters for the data sets used in this report. A power law is used to formulate a relation between the proposed stability parameter and the dimensionless entrainment rate. The new stability assessment method can be used in the design of granular bed protections and for the recognition of the areas of bed protection that require larger stones. The input for the stability parameter can be obtained from numerical flow models.","bed protection; stone stability; acceleration; advective acceleration; turbulence; non-uniform flow; stability parameter; Shields; OpenFOAM; RANS; damage; entrainment; flow","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2014-03-13","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","Environmental Fluid Dynamics","",""

(mentor)","2014","In particular grouping by aesthetics and quality of the media has brought along new challenges for Computational Aesthetics research such as what makes an image beautiful, what means beautiful and how do you quantify beautiful. to meet those challenges, researchers have tried to come up with several algorithms based in different metrics to bridge the gap between the quantitative aspects of what is called beauty and what people call beauty. In order to fill part of this gap we studied the effect of digital filters in photographic aesthetics so widely used in the social networks nowadays. Taking in consideration the popularity of digital filters among many social network users, it was a surprise to understand that most participants in the experiment preferred the images with no filter. In any case measuring what is beautiful always requires collecting aesthetics scores from people. Doing that collection process in a laboratory environment is the most effective approach. The main reasons are the highly controlled environment that leads to good data quality. The downside is cost, time and restriction of participants to the people available nearby. Therefore another issue addressed in the study was the use of crowdsourcing to minimize time and cost, as well as to expand the scope of participation, in the process of collecting image scores from users. To test that possibility a 4 step process step was designed and implemented. First preference scores were collected in a lab environment over a previous selected dataset. Afterwards the crowdsourcing experiment was planned what included an optimization of the dataset (ground truth dataset). Subsequently three digital filters were then applied to the collection and an online experiment followed to once again collect preference scores. In phase, we developed the experiment in the context of Microworkers and as a Facebook app interface enriched with a playful visual interface. The last step included a process to filter the suspicious participants and check results consistency. The results show that implementing an experiment to collect preferences of image quality in social media is a good methodology for Computational Aesthetics, if appropriate planning and management is adopted.","computational aesthetics; crowdsourcing","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Interactive Intelligent Systems Group","","Embedded Systems","",""

(mentor); Desmet, P.M.A. (mentor); Ziegler, M. (mentor)","2014","This project started off with gathering information on gratitude: what it is, how it can be practiced and how it contributes to subjective well-being. Amongst scientific papers, two specifically interesting books can be found: Gratitude works! (Emmons, R. A., 2013) and The How of Happiness: A New Approach to Getting the Life You Want (Lyubomirsky, S., 2007) which can be recommended to everyone with an interest in gratitude. Part 1: Hear In the first part of the report, an analysis is done on rituals, from where gratitude is involved, to more specific ways to practice gratitude (inter alia by means of journals and apps). A deeper understanding is gained about the elements needed to practice gratitude. The problem is not defined by how and when to list or write about good things in life, but rather how to increase people’s conscious awareness (of gratitude’s emotional and symbolic meaning) and how to integrate this practice into daily life. The design goal was therefore: “Making people between 20 and 40 years old (more) aware of the things they can be grateful for in their daily lives.” Part 2: Create In the second part of the report some simple ideas were tested, called probes. First, the probes helped to explore how pleasure can be gained, more directly and from something visible, on the short term when practicing gratitude. Second, it was explored how people can be triggered to practice gratitude regularly in daily life. It was discovered that the target group, of temperate and open-minded people from 20 to 40 years old, does not like extensive writing or deep reflection on gratitude. The majority has simply not thought about another way to practice gratitude in everyday life, some expect it to take much time, to be difficult or they do not expect anything to derive from it. With low-effort taken into consideration, the following vision was created: “Make people practice gratitude as they water flowers, making flower buds bloom with just a simple act in full awareness”. After the importance of involving an element of surprise, providing variation (by offering various gratitude topics) and the right guidance became clear, four concepts were presented. From the four concepts Gratitea, a tea ritual, is chosen to be developed further. The advantage of a tea ritual, is that it is an existing moment in itself, whereas a night lamp (one of the other concepts) is an existing product, but less of a moment. The concept is developed into an incentive to practice gratitude by offering: three ‘assignments’ (that stimulate people to do more than thinking: to cherish a memory, experience the moment and pass something on) and a set of twelve topics, that ensure variation and inspiration. Suggestions on how to practice gratitude and quotes of people’s gratitude experiences were tested with a focus group and then developed into poems. The poems are connected to the twelve topics and inspire people, without depriving their freedom to make a personal interpretation. They may help people to make associations and get them in touch with their feelings. Also a changeover is made from ceramic cups to paper cups, to extend the tea ritual to other hot beverages, making the group of people that can be reached much bigger. Part 3: Deliver The ritual was given a new name: Warm Thoughts. A graphical style that appeals to a large audience and fits the company Creatuals, was developed and the cups were tested in an office environment and coffee house. The idea is that employees and owners of coffeehouses or public spaces (with a hot beverages machine) would need to buy Warm Thoughts, and their (office) workers, customers or visitors just have to choose to take this ‘special’ cup now and then. Recommendations are given that have to be considered when launching Warm Thoughts. Lastly, there is an evaluation on the proces of creating this gratitude ritual, a new step to a life where one is consciously more aware of the good things in life to be grateful for.","gratitude; positive design; DIOPD; subjective well-being; happiness; warm thoughts","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Industrial Design","","Master of Science Design for Interaction","",""

(mentor); De Winter, J.C.F. (mentor)","2014","Abstract – Background: A principal design choice in providing steering wheel force feedback to assist drivers during lane-keeping is whether feedback should be provided for any error with respect to the lane centre (continuous feedback) or only when acceptable tolerance limits are exceeded (bandwidth feedback). Problem: Research has shown that continuously assisting the driver by means of steering wheel force feedback improves driver performance and reduces mental workload. However, it has been suggested that continuous feedback induces aftereffects during subsequent manual driving. Method: In a fixed-base driving simulator study, we evaluated driver performance and mental workload, while drivers (n=32) received corrective force feedback on the steering wheel. Five designs were compared, namely no feedback (Manual), discrete bandwidth feedback (Band1), bandwidth feedback with a hysteresis filter (Band2), continuous feedback with feedback gain used in earlier studies (Cont), and continuous feedback with a feedback gain twice as strong (ContS). While driving the participants performed a secondary peripheral detection task. Participants were told that the feedback was not fully reliable. Towards the end of the trajectory the feedback algorithm was shut down in order to investigate short-term aftereffects. After each trial the participant would fill out a NASA-TLX and a Vanderlaan-questionnaire to measure workload, usefulness and satisfaction. Results: All four feedback designs eliminated the large lane centre deviations that occasionally occur during manual control. Both continuous feedback designs yielded smaller lane centre errors than bandwidth feedback and manual control. Shortly after the feedback was shut down, ContS resulted in worse lane keeping performance than Manual and bandwidth feedback. The secondary task showed a lower reaction time for Cont compared to Band1 and the NASA-TLX indicated lower workload for continuous feedback compared to manual control. The satisfaction scale of the Vanderlaan-questionnaire showed a significantly higher score for Cont compared to Band1. When the feedback shut down, drivers supported by ContS showed a lower minimum TLC, higher mean and maximum absolute lateral error, and more near lane departures. Conclusions: Providing the driver with continuous feedback is an effective way to improve the lane keeping performance and is experienced by drivers as more satisfactory and intuitive, as compared to bandwidth force feedback and manual steering. Bandwidth feedback is equally effective in preventing excessive deviation from the lane centre and did not suffer from the aftereffects that the ContS system did. Stronger continuous feedback resulted in better lane keeping performance, but also in larger aftereffects. The Cont design had a good performance, was perceived as satisfactory and showed no significant short-term aftereffects. Nevertheless, future research should point out if long-term behavioural adaptations lead to stronger aftereffects for continuous systems.","haptic feedback; bandwidth feebdack; continuous feedback; car driving","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2015-09-14","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","BioMechanical Engineering","","BMD","",""

(mentor)","2014","This study develops a theoretical framework to judge in which particular instances a two-dimensional depth-averaged model is sufficient to simulate flow processes in continental shelf seas or when a fully three-dimensional model is required for accurate results. A depth-averaged model does not give any vertical information, which is unfortunate when the model user is interested in it. Moreover, the model output, i.e. the surface elevation and the depth-averaged velocity components, may be affected by omitting the vertical dimension. In a frictionless case, two-dimensional and three-dimensional model results are expected to be similar. First, it is examined whether the reduction from 3D to 2DH has a significant effect on model output by comparing mathematical models with (2DV) and without (1D) vertical information. Localized analytical solutions are derived for the propagation of a single (predominant) tidal constituent in a shallow well-mixed continental shelf sea or estuary. The advective and Coriolis terms are neglected, the eddy viscosity is assumed constant and the bottom friction term is linearised. Special attention is paid to the latter, since both 1D and 2DV responses appear to depend substantially on the way the bottom friction coefficients are defined. The analytical method developed in this study indicates that certain combinations of the higher flow velocities (U > 1 m/s) and water depths (d > 50 m) may cause extensive differences between the results from a depth-averaged model and from a model that contains vertical information. However, it should be kept in mind that those two parameters interact and hence conclusions in general sense are hard to quantify. The resulting findings are tested by conceptual numerical simulations of steady and unsteady, periodic flows in a schematized rectangular basin. The results obtained from a three-dimensional simulation are compared to those from a two-dimensional depth-averaged simulation. Both simulations show good correspondence with the analytical solutions. As the development of the study is motivated by practical problems in the North Sea, its implementation is tested using the European Continental Shelf Model in both two-dimensional and three-dimensional version. A simple iteration procedure is performed to investigate what regions in the flow domain may be important. After an orienting 2D calculation a reasonably simple post-processing step reveals interesting locations where 2D and 3D results are expected to deviate strongly. For these specific locations the performance of the numerical models is analysed and compared. The case study confirms that the modeller needs to be careful when it comes to two-dimensional depth-averaged hydrodynamic modelling of large-scale domains like the European Continental Shelf Sea. For tidal propagation through large parts of the Central North Sea the flow velocities are rather low (U = 0.2 m/s) and hence two-dimensional (depth-averaged) models are adequate to calculate flow velocities. For several other regions though, being the English Channel, the Irish Sea and around the Orkney Islands, it is shown that it is required to be prudent with interpreting the two-dimensional results.","two-dimensional; depth-averaged; numerical model; continental shelf sea; analytical solution; three-dimensional; tidal propagation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","","",""

In addition, the model offers flexible conflict resolution and optimal use of data stored offline. The model is implemented on top of Windows Azure Mobile Service (WAMS), which is the (M)BaaS system offered by Microsoft. This implementation shows that the model works and that it can be successfully applied to an (M)BaaS system.

(mentor); Van Duin, J.H.R. (mentor)","2014","Schiphol, the main airport of the Netherlands, wants to be Europe’s preferred cargo airport. To reach this status, Schiphol has to offer a good infrastructure and high quality processes. Schiphol has no active role in these processes, but is dependent on third parties. Schiphol suffers from inefficiencies in the air cargo supply chain. A symptom for the inefficiencies in the chain is the queuing of trucks which was the trigger to start this research. The air cargo supply chain involves many parties: the shipper, the consignee, handlers, trucking companies, airlines and freight forwarders. Airports only have a facilitating role in supporting the air cargo supply chain. The research question for this research comes forth out of the aforementioned role and goals of Schiphol: How can Schiphol in its facilitating role enhance the quality of the air cargo supply chain at Schiphol? To identify the issues influencing the air cargo supply chain at Schiphol the chain has been analysed in two perspectives; the system perspective and the actor perspective. The system perspective involves the process steps in the chain. The actor perspective involves the roles and the relations of the actors in the chain. Following these analyses, scientific literature on information sharing and process management has been consulted. To find out how information sharing can be successful and how Schiphol should behave. System perspective The system perspective analysis resulted in several issues: Check-ins: the geography of the air cargo area at Schiphol causes several check-in gates to the terrains of the different handlers in 1 visit for trucks; A lot of documents are involved in the air cargo supply chain, which causes inaccuracy and superfluous process steps in the chain; Three points of queuing: the air cargo supply chain at Schiphol has three points of possible queuing; at the entrance of the terrains of the handlers, at the handlers office and before docking; The employees at an operational level have a big influence on the progress in the chain; Patterns: the air cargo supply chain is subject to weekly and daily patterns, that increases the queuing at several peak points in time; First Come – First Served; not always the best system for an efficient chain; Capriciousness of arrivals of both trucks and airplanes makes the processes unpredictable; The amount of pre-announcements is low and causing unexpectedness at several points in the chain, especially at handlers. To solve several of these issues the existing projects E-freight (international) and E-link (national) are developed and can reduce the amount of documents involved and interfere in the processes. With E-link the administration will be simplified and it will take some process steps and queues out of the chain, in this way the chain will be more effective. Although these are projects are promising, unfortunately the progress of the implementation of information sharing systems lacks behind. Furthermore, the implementation level of the ACN-card (check-in card for truck drivers) is so far not very high, because of the coupling with the E-link system this implementation level is very important. Actor perspective With 6 handlers with direct airside access, above 150 trucking companies and over 80 freight forwarders the actor perspective in the air cargo supply chain is characterised by the broad network of actors. A freight forwarder is the middleman in the transportation of the freight and determines the route of the cargo. The airline has contracts with the handlers and the trucking companies. The trucking companies and the involved handlers are not contractual related. This situation makes a good cooperation between the handlers and truckers more difficult. Issues resulted from the actor perspective analysis: Conservative character of the air cargo supply chain worldwide causes a lack of progress in innovation implementation; The education and motivation of employees at the operational level is low; The personal involvement during the air cargo handling is high, but not always rational; The actor analysis showed that there is a desire to work together, however, the cooperation is at a low level. This is caused by the commercial interest, the economic survival mode of the companies and the low level of willingness to invest in local systems by the handlers headquarters. Next to the actor relations and operational influence, the air cargo supply chain has suffered from the economic crisis of the past few years a lot. The lowering amount of transported cargo caused lower margins on the handling of freight. The revenues of most companies involved lowered and cost cuttings are the result. These cost cuttings influence the capacity at handlers and trucking companies and these lowering capacities result in efficiencies in the chain. Literature The literature research showed the advantages an information sharing system could have: Better planning by an increasing amount of pre-announcements; Personal behaviour can be steered; Lower amount of document involvement; Could be used for performance measurement in the total supply chain to improve the performance of the chain; Supports building of trustworthy relationships. Several issues should be kept in mind when developing information sharing between actors: Quality of the information is more important than faster sharing of information; Securing of information to keep the commercial values protected; For planning issues dynamic systems are necessary; Interoperability with IT-systems of several actors, otherwise influence at operational level makes acceptance hard; Easy to use at an operational level, clear protocols and routines are necessary for acceptance; To be able to implement an information sharing system into a chain a good relation is necessary and commitment to develop and implement the system. Synthesis The air cargo supply chain would be aided with the use of an information sharing system as E-link. A local system as E-link is hard to implement but has its advantages in better planning and the building of relations between involved actors. The most significant results in the processes of the air cargo supply chain at Schiphol can be found in: Reduction of document use in the chain; Reduction of truck turn time; Reduction of FTE’s at the handlers office; The progress in implementation lacks behind, however. The financial feasibility, even with a low percentage of efficiency savings of even 5,7% industry wide with a 100% implementation should be enough to convince the involved parties to invest. The economic influence is, however, very big and causes hard ways in the implementation of innovations in combination with the actor situation at Schiphol. In economic difficult times the demand for a powerful and reliable process manager is higher, Schiphol could fulfil that role. A shared value or goal should be created; Naming and framing of the problems and solutions; Creation of a sense of urgency; Incentive development; Protection of core values of companies; Schiphol should fit this role as a process manager well, because their interests in the air cargo supply chain at Schiphol is high and they have a reliable and powerful appearance, even when they are not directly involved in the air cargo supply chain. Conclusion & recommendations An information sharing system definitely has its advantages and would really help the air cargo supply chain at Schiphol to improve in quality and be able to attract more business. Further growth of air cargo volumes can be handled easily by this process improvement. The role for Schiphol is to be the process manager of innovations and implementations in the air cargo supply chain at Schiphol. Where Schiphol mainly should focus at in the complex system: Interoperability of the E-link system with systems at the several actors; Protection of core values of companies involved in implementation; Security and quality of information; Better naming and framing of E-link advantages; Transparency at both operational and managerial level, respectively clear protocols and insight in individual actor costs and benefits; Increase of ACN-card adoption. Because of the economic situation a good timing is necessary to find enough commitment for investment, it is realised that the economic situations has left its scars in the air cargo supply chain. Furthermore, the building of relationships is a long and hard process, but it is important for the success of innovation implementation in the air cargo supply chain at Schiphol. Further research should be focussed mainly at solving the unsolved issues with information sharing, like the multiple check-ins, the employee education and motivation and the increase of the ACN-card adoption.","air cargo supply chain; Schiphol","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","2014-03-28","Technology, Policy and Management","Systems Engineering","","","",""

(mentor); Simonsz, H. (mentor)","2014","Strabismus ('squinting') affects about 5% of the western population. It can be treated through surgery. The most important determinant of the outcome of strabismus surgery is the measurement of the angles of strabismus. Currently this measurement is performed manually using prisms. Inaccuracies in the measurement of the angles of strabismus account for about 20% of the total variance of the angles of strabismus after surgery. To improve the outcome of surgery, the Delft Assessment Instrument for Strabismus in Young children (DAISY) is under development. DAISY measures the angles of strabismus using two optical methods that determine the eye- and head position. In eye movement measurement, conventional calibration methods require the subjects to fixate at known points. The problem is that it will remain uncertain if the young subjects fixated at these points. In this study an objective calibration method for eye movement measurements was presented. The proposed method used the Brückner effect: When an eye is illuminated by a light coaxial with the observing eye or camera, the light is reflected by the back of the eye and a red reflex will be observed through the pupil. The intensity of this red reflex varies with the angle of eccentric gaze. The red reflex darkens as the eye fixates at the light source. To establish the Brückner effect as a valid tool for objective calibration of the projection of the fovea in optical eye movement measurement, a number of preconditions were drawn up. These resulted in the main research questions: Is the red fundus reflex intensity at central foveal fixation significantly lower than the red fundus reflex intensity at eccentric fixation? Is the method repeatable on a inter-individual level and on a intra-individual level? Remaining interesting topics resulted in secondary research questions: What characterises the relation between eye rotation and red fundus reflex intensity? Is the method repeatable on a inter-ocular level? What is the estimated accuracy of the calibration method? The intensity of the red fundus reflex and the eye movements were measured continuously while the subject followed a fixation object that moved back and forth horizontally in front of a camera. The eyes were illuminated coaxially using an infrared light source and a beamsplitter. The result was a 'reflex profile': the tendency of the relation between horizontal eye rotation and red fundus reflex intensity. By varying the eye rotation in vertical direction by changing the height of the fixation object, also two dimensional profiles of the red fundus reflection were made ('scans'). Although the scan images were coarse, it is the first known method to attain images of the retina from a distance. The red fundus reflex at central foveal fixation was significantly darker than the red fundus reflex at eccentric fixation. The right eye of 5 out of 6 subjects showed a clearly distinguishable minimum red fundus reflex with foveal fixation on or very near the center of the observing lens and coaxial infrared light. The remaining subject had difficulties with fixating at the moving fixation object. Optimisation of the speed of the fixation object will likely prevent similar future difficulties. The characteristics of the relation between horizontal eye rotation and red fundus reflex intensity showed interesting unexpected reproducible local effects left and right of the fovea for all eyes of all subjects. These effects probably have an anatomical nature. To determine the intra-individual repeatability, repeated measurements were performed on 3 subjects. The repeated reflex profiles and local anatomical effects were very similar. The small differences in eye rotation at which the local extrema were found are probably caused by inaccuracies in the eye movement measurement. To determine the inter-ocular repeatability, both the left and right eyes of 3 subjects were measured. Although similar mirrored reflex profiles were expected for the two eyes of one subject, the local extrema did not correspond and the course of both reflex profiles was different. It seems plausible that the two eyes of one subject differ anatomically. The calibration accuracy was determined to be 0.343°±0.338° (worst case scenario) in 6 subjects, a third of the overall accuracy DAISY aims for. As all stated preconditions were achievable, the Brückner effect can be used as objective calibration method for eye movement measurement. This is the first known objective calibration method. The findings of this study exclude two of five possible causes of the Brückner effect and support Brückners original reasoning behind the darkening of the red fundus reflex with foveal fixation: the macular pigmentation being densest at the fovea.","Brückner DAISY Eye Tracking Calibration","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2019-03-13","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","BioMechanical Engineering","","BMD","",""

This work examines the aforementioned subject from two of its aspects; mobile re-finding behaviour and queries' contextual information. Re-finding behaviour is an well-known phenomenon amongst the big search engines. It describes the tendency people have to search for contents of a web page they have already viewed before. This also applies to internet access through mobile environment. Studies have shown that identifying and exploiting this phenomenon can lead to improving the availability of information while reducing the cost of access. However, according to previous work, the phenomenon is declining and with the work of this thesis, we inspect its current state. In parallel with that, we examine mobile search semantics in the context of topic, time and location. Analysis on this contextual information helps us better understand users' online behaviour. For the purposes of the project, an Android Logging Framework was developed which was used to perform a live user study with 14 smartphone users, for the duration of a month. Results showed a 5,52% of average re-finding behaviour amongst the participants, while revealing patterns concerning their search queries. Topic of the searches is influenced by the time of the day, as well as the location of the users. Finally, a high number of searches have migrated from the browser to a richer and more intuitive environment, that of topic-specific applications.","mobile search; re-finding; query topic; query location","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Software Technology","","Web Information Systems","",""

(mentor); Van Breemen, E.J.J. (mentor); Schiele, A. (mentor); Van der Hulst, F. (mentor)","2014","The following thesis reports the graduation project done at the ESA Telerobotics & Haptics Lab by the Industrial Design Engineering student Emiel den Exter. The assignment was to design a set of upper body orthoses for astronauts, which are used to attach force-reflecting arm-exoskeletons to the human body. Exoskeletons are lightweight robotics that are worn on the human body that can sense movements by the user and deliver force feedback through several actuators. Using teleoperation, astronauts can control target robotic devices with their own arm movement using the exoskeleton. The focus points were to improve the comfort, the ease of use and the time necessary to put on and take off (donning & doffing) the exoskeleton. In addition, the new design had to fit an international target population ranging from p1 to p99. The goal was to have a working prototype by the end of the project and to evaluate this on basis of the previously mentioned focus points. The approach to the project involved a literature study, idea and concept phases, a materialization phase and an evaluation phase. The project started with a review of the current problems related to the existing orthoses designs, based on observations and interviews with researchers that use the exoskeletons. The problems found were mainly related to improper fit of the orthoses and the difficulty of putting them on properly. A literature analysis of several topics served as a basis for generating new product ideas and solutions that were presented to the client. The topics included: optimal load carrying by human beings, optimal fit based on user anthropometry and several topics related to state-of-the-art in wearable robotics. One of the main findings was that the torso orthosis (vest) and the exoskeleton should be separated from each other allowing the user to properly don the orthosis before connecting with the exoskeleton. In addition, in order to fit different body types the orthoses had to be adjustable in size and would have fasteners integrated that only required one hand to open, close and adjust. Based on the ideas and found solutions a final concept design was generated. The concept included a vest design, two arm braces and an interface to connect the vest with an exoskeleton. The vest and braces were adjustable at several points to fit a wide range of body sizes. To assure fit in all users ranging from p1 to p99, several parts were designed to come in small, medium, and large sizes. The connecting interface was a design based on magnetic snap locks similar to the fasteners designed by the company Fidlock. This allows the operator to connect an exoskeleton to the back of the vest, without requiring visual overview. The complete concept was prototyped using a combination of traditionally manufactured parts and SLS 3D printed components. The prototype was tested using several subjects from outside the lab to evaluate comfort, ease of use and donning and doffing efficiency. In addition, several tests were performed in the lab with an exoskeleton attached to the vest to evaluate the use of a mobile exoskeleton design. In conclusion, very positive results were achieved with the new orthoses designs. All previously mentioned focus points were improved upon regarding the vest design. However, the areas with most room for improvement are the arm orthoses. The new designs improved donning and doffing, but were still considered somewhat uncomfortable to wear. The exoskeleton connection interface design showed a lot of potential if the tolerances and strength are improved. The separation of the vest from the exoskeleton gave the opportunity to improve the donning and doffing efficiency in ways that had not been possible otherwise.","design; telerobotics; haptics; anthropometry","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Industrial Design","","Master of Science Integrated Product Design","",""

(mentor); De Rijk, T.R.A. (mentor)","2014","This graduation project, entitled “Creating festival nights, growing your own overnight festival accommodation”, contains the process of a study that was performed to elicit the interaction possibilities during the overnight stay at Zwarte Cross in order to create a festival night, which ultimately led up to the design of Freedom Village. Zwarte Cross is hosted by the company de Feestfabriek alles komt goed bv and was currently looking for new camping solutions in order to maintain their image of biggest and innovative festival in the Netherlands. The research phase that was performed on the basis of a brainstorm session, observational research at festivals and a literature study was carried out to investigate design possibilities for the initial company Campcribs. This company focuses on temporary festival accommodation executed in cardboard and wants to tackle the environmental issues of camping gear waste that is left behind by the festival visitors after the event. In addition, this company wanted to facilitate ease of use by offering accommodations that were set up prior to the event and collected after the festival by Campcribs. The outcomes of the research were combined and together formed the input for assembling the personas and their customer journey’s. These personas are fictional profiles that expose the wants and needs of real people and represent the target group. The customer journey reveals how the personas experience the current context from the moment they buy a festival ticket, untill their return at home and memorizing the festival. The journey does not only elicit the current context, but also shows underdeveloped stages and design possibilities by inserting quotes deriving from the research. At the end of the synthesis of the research, the cooperation with Campcribs was ended and we parted our ways. During the search for a new external client, the company that hosts Zwarte Cross festival, de Feestfabriek, showed interest in the performed research. Together with their requirements and after a careful executed analysis on Zwarte Cross, the outcomes were refined and an interaction vision was created. This vision guided me through the further process and derived directly out of the research. The ‘birds building a nest together’ interaction vision represents the most prominent four aspects that emerged during the research and translated into seven symbols. These four ; sharing, discovering, open sleeping and DIY(do it yourself), were the main input for the idea generation and constantly taken into account during the process. The idea generation generated three clusters, which were converted into visual concepts, that all contain parts of the research outcomes and meet the previously established design statement; “I want to create an overnight stay at a festival by means of a shared experience, allowing people to actually want to sleep at the camping area, instead of having to.” After evaluating the three concepts by revealing their strenghts and weaknesses, one final concept was chosen, which contains several elements of all the three concepts and was translated into one coherent story. This final ‘Freedom Village’ concept represents a collective way of sleeping at a festival, by creating an actual community. Freedom Village is part of the camping area at Zwarte Cross and can only be entered when you are a citizen of the village. When being a citizen of Freedom Village, you do not have to bring your own camping gear, but all the sleeping places will be there when you arrive, reverting to the initial research problem when starting the project. The area consists of a cornfield, wherein the residents can create their own paths and places to sleep in. In addition, a huge bedstead is designed, together with haystacks covered by haybarns and one big straw construction, which can be customized with tractor inner tubes in order to extent your comfort and make your own bed. These three sleeping possibilities can be found in the cornfield landscape and offer enough sleeping places for the intended 200 citizens of Freedom Village. The main idea behind Freedom Village is that you do not have a permanent sleeping place, but switch whenever you re-enter the area. In this way, people are challenged to get out of their comfort zone and meet new people, creating a shared experience. The open structure of the sleeping acitivity meets the interaction vision, as also the discovering and DIY aspects. The Zwarte Cross identity appears in the playful character of Freedom Village and connection with the local suppliers of the materials. Besides this, Zwarte Cross can attract great media attention by revealing the link with charity, which is expressed in the donation of the corn and hay to the Familie Bofkont, a farm for duped pigs. During the development of Freedom Village, the need for an incentive phase emerged, since the preparation gets lost within the concept, because you do not have to bring your own camping gear anymore. The design goal was to change the customer journey and take all the stages of this journey into account. The design of the incentive phase focuses on the first part of the journey by taking the future citizens by the hand and slowly revealing the concept of Freedom Village. A tangible entry ticket is sent to their homes after signing up on the website of Zwarte Cross and this ticket includes a cornseed, which you can grow yourself at home. During the growth of this plant, you can follow the updates of Freedom Village on Facebook and meet your fellow residents, while the real cornfield at the area is growing. The simultaneous development of your own cornplant will elicit a shared experience prior to the event and creates a complete customer journey. In the end of the project, a usertest was carried out, focusing on the first part of customer journey. The insights deriving from this test together with refined requirements from the company formed the input for the redesign and recommendations, which will further be explored and developed after this graduation project.","sharing; festival; discovering; DIY","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Industrial Design","","Master of Science Design for Interaction","",""

(mentor)","2014","A design study was carried out at the German Aerospace Center (DLR) in Bremen, investigating the optimal structural design for a lunar greenhouse module. On account of the volume requirements of a lunar greenhouse and the volume constraints of modern launchers, the study has considered only inflatable and hybrid structures. A literature study was performed on the existing technologies and concepts of fully inflatable and partially inflatable (hybrid) space habitats and structures. Additionally, a review of the lunar environment was carried out and the impact on the lunar greenhouse module structure design was determined. Using system engineering tools, the structural requirements of the greenhouse module were defined. Concepts, such as a cylinder or semi-cylinder, were developed and assessed using an Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP). A preliminary design of the structure was performed for the selected concept, a semi-cylinder with rigid end-caps and a flexible middle section. For the preliminary design, the gas retention properties as well as the micro-meteoroid and radiation shielding capabilities were designed and thermal and load-bearing properties of the structure were analysed. Additionally, a possible configuration of the greenhouse module interior was presented and interfaces between the rigid and flexible sections of the structure, as well as between the structure and other lunar base structures were discussed. Verification of the preliminary design calculations and the compliance with the requirements was carried out for the thermal and load-bearing structural properties, using the finite element analysis tool MSC Nastran. The final structure design is a semi-cylindrical hybrid structure with rigid end-caps, 20 m in length and with a 3 m radius and with a total mass of 43786 kg. Radiation protection is provided by covering the structure with regolith-filled bags. A total thickness of approximately 2,5 m of regolith needs to be applied to the greenhouse to provide sufficient protection for the astronauts and plants within during the envisioned two year mission lifetime.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","Space System Engineering","","","",""

(mentor); Thomassen, E.W. (mentor)","2014","Purix is a Danish start-up company with a production facility in Bari. Their product is a 2,5kW absorption chiller system for small businesses and consumers. The market area will be Italy in the first place with extension to other southern European markets. The high temparatures and solar irradiation make Southern Eu- rope a very suitable market for the Purix chiller. Consumer and businesses will have a return on investment of approximately 6 years compared to efficient vapour compressed air conditioning units, because of the low electrical energy consumption of the chiller. Purix aims to deliver the first affordable all inclusive solar air-con- ditioning unit including fan-coil and solar heat panels. At the start- ing point of this industrial design project, all components have been sized and some choices where made for product assem- bly. However no attention was yet set on the overall assembly, framing and enclosure of the product. Purix aimed for a high end product appearance while respecting an extremely tight budget. A lot of effort has been added into cost saving and simplification of components while remaining the simplicity and elegance of the first generated product concepts. An additional challenge is the small starting series. A full scale visual model has been build in Delft to check material choices and fastener locations and chosen assem- bly method. although the available tooling was not sufficient and comparable to the possibilities for series production, the shape and construction worked as expected. The clamping profile has been a good choice to define prod- uct contours, close small production tolerances and protect users for sharp edges. Since this is Purix first product, sales still have to scale up. The design should therefor respect the possibility to make changes if component or assembly choices turn out to be non satisfac- tory. Therefor at this point of time the use of complicated molds is not an option. For that reason the enclosure is entirely build with single curved panels. The elegant naturally curved contour clamping profile gives the product shape and differentiation from conventional block shaped cooling units. The eccentric fan is hidden behind a sheet of stretched metal, this choice enables the product to be symmetric from all sides. The chiller is suitable for placement below the included solar heat panels or for stand-alone applications. A promising example of a stand alone application for Middle and Northern European countries is a connection to district heating instead of solar heat panels. Generally district heating is indus- trial waste heat and there is no market for it during summer.","air conditioning; solar; absorption; enclosure","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","2015-03-12","Industrial Design Engineering","Design Engineering","","Master of Science Integrated Product Design","",""

(mentor)","2014","Vietnam has developed very fast over the past decades and is growing both in population and economic power rapidly. Especially the march of a middle-class is pushing the consumerism to a higher level; people have more money to spend on for example luxury items and food. Private food consumption is one of the most important areas with a big impact on the environmental sustainability. Sustainability is however still an unknown concept among the majority of Vietnamese consumers. The main goal of the project developed in this thesis was to provoke behaviour change of Vietnamese middle-class households towards sustainable food consumption with the use of a physical tool. Elaborate contextual research, conducted during a three month stay in Hanoi, was used to identify problematic behaviour wihin the area of food consumption. Throughout the project Vietnamese experts and organizations were consulted to ensure the concept would fit the Vietnamese context. The topic of ‘food safety’ (often linked to the term ‘sustainability’) grabs everyone’s attention in Vietnam.It is and has been a major problem, leaving consumers in despair. Especially young mothers are concerned about the health of their children and family. Although the government tries to improve the production of safe and organic vegetables with laws and regulations, a trustful system has not yet been established. The vast majority of the consumers still buy conventional vegetables that are produced with the use of chemical pesticides and fertilizers. Especially the intake of pesticide residues by young babies during their first two years can have a negative impact on the development of the baby’s brain and immune system. The final design proposed in this thesis is the ‘Bottle Garden’ toolkit that empowers young mothers in Vietnamese middle-class households to start growing safe vegetables for their baby at home. The toolkit emphasizes the importance of consuming safe/organic produced vegetables. This graduation project was executed within the GetGreen Vietnam Project, which the TU Delft is part of. The overall aim of the GetGreen Vietnam project is promoting sustainable consumption among Vietnamese middle-class consumers in urban areas. The outcomes will be implemented in the designed methodology of GetGreen Vietnam.","toolkit; Vietnam; food; behaviour; sustainable","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Design Engineering","","Master of Science Design for Interaction","",""

A traffic simulator provides a high degree of control, as every traffic situation can be recreated with exactly the same conditions for all test subjects. The downside of working with a simulator is the limited validity. When simulating a new situation, observing valid driving behavior from the test subjects requires valid simulated background traffic. In order to generate valid background traffic, realistic driving models are needed for that specific situation. This creates a vicious circle, as the realistic observations that are not observed yet are required to generate realistic driving models. The purpose of this research is to generate realistic simulated traffic for new situations. Using the Bayesian inference method in an online feedback loop, observed driving behavior from test subjects is used to calibrate existing driving models. These models are fed back to the simulator, where they will be used to generate traffic with the information gathered from the subjects. The influence of implementing a Bayesian-inference based feedback loop on subjective validity of the simulated traffic is tested in various experiments. The results show that a direct comparison, where the updated traffic and non-updated traffic are observed in the same session, results in an increase in subjective validity. An indirect comparison does not lead to an increase in subjective validity. The conclusion from the results is that, although the feedback loop leads to an increase in subjective validity, the effect is not strong enough to be noticeable when comparing traffic from two separate sessions.","Bayesian inference; car-following; simulation validity","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Delft Center for Systems and Control","","","",""

A two-phase optimisation approach was adopted in order to achieve stepwise performance improvement using raw water (taken from one of Singapore’s reservoirs) as a case study. “Phase I” focused on the simulation of the inline coagulation/UF process composed of coagulation in jar test followed by immediate filtration with 0.05um paper filter, while “Phase II” consisted of the operation of a bench scale hybrid inline coagulation/UF system equipped with a pressurized membrane module in laboratory. The main focus area for “Phase I” was the identification of optimum alternative coagulant among aluminium chlorohydrate (ACH), polyaluminum chloride (PACl) and ferric chloride (FeCl3) compared to aluminium sulphate (alum). “Phase II” supplementary applied the previous findings of the selected coagulant and dosage in order to optimise the membrane performance during operation of a bench scale hybrid inline coagulation/ultrafiltration system. The experiments in “Phase II” included runs at different fluxes in the range of 72-146L/m2/h, for the determination of the fouling behaviour in terms of transmembrane pressure (TMP), fouling tendency and specific flux (K). The critical operational flux values were also estimated which might help in the determination of a “sustainable flux” under the operating conditions investigated. It was found that for “Phase I” the optimum coagulant would be ACH in a dosage of 1.7mg (Al)/L, with a TOC removal efficiency (40%) comparable to alum (35-45%), good effluent turbidity and acceptable dissolved aluminium concentration <0.05mg/L without the need of pH pre-adjustment, while usage of lime for pH post-adjustment could be reduced. In “Phase II”, from the elaboration of the results under different fluxes, the critical flux (Jcs) was roughly estimated around 20 L/m2/h, for the threshold flux (Jthr) a range around 90-125 L/m2/h was selected, while for the critical flux for irreversibility (Jci) and the “sustainable flux” non-quantified suggestions were made. Regarding the operational parameters, even though an exact flux has not been clearly proposed, the alternative of 94 L/m2/h stood out as it resulted compared always with the flux of around 74 L/m2/h, to a 5% improvement in specific flux, 16% increase in the average TMP, while the fouling rate remained similar to lower fluxes at around 0.16bar/h with a backwashable component after 1.5h being at 70% and dropping to 65% for the first 3h. Recommendations for the final selection have been given as there are a plethora of subjective operational parameters that need to be taken into account.","coagulation; flux; optimisation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2019-03-11","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Water Management","","NUS-TUD Double Degree Programme in Hydraulic Engineering and Water Resources Management","",""

In this thesis, an assessment framework is developed to determine the viability of an energy storage system for a DSO taking a technical-economic approach. The framework is constructed by gathering and analysing information on several levels concerning energy storage systems within the distribution grid from a technical, economic and regulatory perspective. For an energy storage system to be viable for a DSO, the system must have a positive return on investment and comply with the technical requirements of the following energy storage applications: voltage control, black start, capacity support and electric service power quality. To extend the framework, a network analysis is developed to determine the effect of energy storage on the loads in an MV network and the associated grid reinforcement cost. The developed framework is applied to determine the viability a new energy storage technology; Power-to-Gas. Although Power-to-Gas is able to perform capacity support and black start applications, the technology is not financially viable for a DSO due to the very low round-trip efficiency.","energy storage; electricity distribution grid; assessment framework development; network modelling; capacity support","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Technology, Policy and Management","Energy & Industry","","MSc Systems Engineering, Policy Analysis, and Management","",""

(mentor); Swuste, P.H.J.J. (mentor); Van der Voort, H.G. (mentor); Van Dijk, F. (mentor)","2014","The responsibility for safety in the Dutch construction industry is changing. The former Health and Safety act contains a lot of detailed requirements. However, the new law sets out generic safety targets instead of prescribing safety equipment and measures. Companies have more freedom to choose how the regulatory requirements are met. This encourages the development of a safety policy that is customized to the individual company or sector. In this framework, the private sector has taken over the responsibility to implement general principles and targets described in the Health and Safety Act. The inspectorates withdraw and act more as system regulators in the new situation. The question is whether the market is capable to bear the responsibility to safeguard public goods, such as occupational safety? This question is put to the crane sector which made also the shift from government regulation towards market or self-regulation. Information about accidents and policy instruments in the crane sector of the Dutch construction industry are used to gain insight how the crane sector deals with the responsibility. Accident reports of the Labour Inspectorate and several construction equipment services have been gathered. Besides the accident reports also literature and experts have been consulted. The accident information has been represented using bowtie models and classified by scenarios. Load instability counts for more than 70 % of the accidents. Crane instability does not occur frequently, although experts do see this event as the most dominant one. The technical improvements on cranes could explain the limited contribution of instability of crane, boom and hoisting mechanism to accidents. However, this relation is not analysed. Accidents caused by falling loads do occur frequently. Further research on this type of accidents is necessary. A lot of accident reports lack information about safety barriers and management influence and their relation with the accident causation. Reports should be improved by adding this information. The quality of the accident reports of the construction equipment services illustrates the limited use of accident information as input for the decision making processes in the crane sector. The knowledge about crane safety is mainly based on tacit knowledge and perception instead of accident scenarios. This knowledge can easily drain out of a company, as it is mainly located at one or a few employers. Moreover the tacit knowledge can be influenced by perception. The influence of perception can be observed at the results of the expert meetings. The use of accident scenarios can help the Dutch crane industry to improve their decision making processes concerning crane safety. Therefore crane accident should be well registered and analysed. The bowtie model can help to make the translation from accident to accident scenarios. If the accident scenarios are used adequately all necessary relevant safety information is available to adapt the input mechanisms. The huge fragmentation of the crane sector plays also a role. The construction industry is characterised by a large number of companies. Many contractors and subcontractors use cranes or hire them. The responsibility for safety issues is also widely scattered among these firms. As a consequence information about crane accidents is mostly registered at the company who is primarily responsible. At this moment culture is to shift away the responsibility in case of an accident. As a result the necessarily accident analyses is only performed by the party that has the legal obligation to do so. The spreading of accident information hampers the use of the results of the analyses in the development of adequate policy instruments. A central place where crane accidents could be reported and analyses are collected would be an enormous step forward. If accidents and accident analyses are gathered it become possible to analyse at large scale the actual state of crane safety in the construction sector. A collective analyse of accidents with use of a transparent methodology to analyse accidents, such as the bowtie model, will make it possible for the crane sector to control the issues concerning crane safety. These are necessary steps for the sector in order to be able to bear the responsibility about crane safety.","crane; accident; scenario; safety; regulation; construction","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Technology, Policy and Management","Safety Science","","","",""

(mentor); Kok, M. (mentor); Hrachowitz, M. (mentor); Euser, T. (mentor); Gao, H. (mentor)","2014","Direct measurement of river discharge is time consuming and financially demanding. Continuous river discharge measurements are therefore generally derived from continuous stage measurements, through a stage-discharge relation, also called a rating curve. Rating curves are determined by fitting a curve to a limited number of points (hi, Qi), whereby hi and Qi represent stage and discharge measured in a certain cross-section of a river at a fixed geographical location. Commonly these points (hi, Qi) originate from measurements done under regular flow conditions, due to which a considerable part of the curve is based on interpolation and extrapolation. Therefore the uncertainty in the rating curve particularly during floods can be considerable, which directly translates into uncertainty in the discharge data. Calibrating a model on uncertain discharge observations leads to biased model parameter estimates, which directly lead to biased model predictions. This research shows an approach whereby a conceptual rainfall-runoff model is calibrated on the basis of stage data only. In addition to the existing conceptual model parameters, extra parameters have been added that define the rating curve. A stepwise calibration method has been applied whereby first the rating curve parameters were determined and subsequently the remaining model parameters. Once the rating curve parameters had been fixed, the reanalysed hydrograph was established using the observed stage readings. Subsequently, the model hypotheses on catchment behaviour were tested by conventional methods. In this research these methods have been applied to the scarcely gauged Endau River catchment, located in the South-East of peninsula Malaysia. The initial results are promising. It was found that the rating curve parameters are well defined and optimise to values that correspond to the physical property they represent. When comparing the reanalysed rating curve with the original rating curve it can be seen that the initial part of the rating curve overlaps, corresponding with the most reliable part of the original rating curve. When comparing the reanalysed rating curves with discharge measurements, a high correspondence is observed, while the similarity between the measurements and the original rating curve is very low. Finally, the modelled hydrographs appear to be relatively well able to mimic the reanalysed hydrograph, even though it was impossible to find a proper model for the original hydrograph. To test the sensitivity of the calibrated rating curve to model structure, both a lumped and a topography driven model structure have been tested. Additionally, these models were exposed to two rating curve definitions and a variable model forcing. The results of this sensitivity analysis show that the calibrated rating curve is relatively insensitive to model structure and relatively sensitive to the number of parameters used for the rating curve definition. Concerning the forcing, the rating curve is highly sensitive to precipitation and less sensitive to potential evaporation. The reason for this sensitivity is that the established rating curve is strongly determined by the water balance, which is dominated by the primary driver P. The calibrated models have been validated on independent data by split-sample validation and by transfer to a different catchment. The topography driven models appear to perform best during both forms of validation. An additional way of validating was carried out by coupling the best performing rainfall-runoff model to a steady state salt intrusion model: a novel approach which offers mutual model validation. The results show that the predicted discharge of the rainfall-runoff model corresponds rather well with the discharge determined by the salt model. So, the most important conclusions from this research are: calibration of a rainfall-runoff model on stage reduces discharge uncertainty in scarcely gauged basins; topography driven models are better transferable than lumped models; and linking a salt intrusion model to a rainfall-runoff model offers mutual model improvement.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Water Management","","Hydrology","",""

(mentor); Busoniu, L. (mentor)","2014","Optimistic Planning is a model-based online planning algorithm that guarantees near-optimal actions for the control arbitrarily nonlinear systems. Planning algorithms aim to find optimal actions by starting from the current state and developing a tree representation of sequences of actions and resulting states, using a model to simulate state-transitions. Typically, online planning algorithms return a sequence of actions, apply the first action (or several actions at the start of the sequence) and start planning again from the new state, resembling the receding horizon principle as seen in Model Predictive Control. Several optimistic planning algorithms exist, of which in this work only Optimistic Planning for Deterministic systems (OPD) is considered. OPD works for large, possibly infinite state spaces, but only for finite, discrete action spaces. Unfortunately, while OPD shows good theoretical near-optimality guarantees, there is no record yet of OPD being applied to control nonlinear physical systems in real-time. This is because of the (long) computation required by OPD. This work analyzes two main methods that can be used to make OPD suitable for real-time applications. The first approach is to increase the computational speed of the planning process by parallelizing the algorithm. Unfortunately, while parallelization has been proven to be able to increase the computational speed in classical planning, in experiments no improvement is found yet for OPD using parallelization. However, a potential benefit from creating a parallel version of OPD is not ruled out and it is expected that more research and more efficient implementations could still lead to an increase in the computational speed. The second approach is to apply sequences of actions instead of single actions, which increases the time available for the planning process. Re-planning starts immediately after a sequence is returned, using as initial state a prediction of the state at the end of the previous sequence. The resulting algorithm is called Real-Time Optimistic Planning with Action Sequences (RT-OPS). Extensive analysis is performed to find restrictions on the parameters of the algorithm that, when met, can guarantee real-time applicability. Additionally, the effect of using sequences of actions on the performance of the algorithm is investigated and bounds are put on the maximum performance loss. The performance of RT-OPS has been tested in various experiments on different problems: a cart-pole simulation, an acrobot simulation and a real inverted pendulum. Different settings are compared and, overall, RT-OPS proves to perform well, without violating real-time constraints. The experiments prove that RT-OPS allows for the use of optimistic planning for real-time control of physical nonlinear systems. Future work should focus on applying the ideas used to develop RT-OPS to other optimistic planning algorithms, such as those that allow for continuous actions or stochastic systems. Furthermore, a parallelization of RT-OPS could be developed that increases its computational speed.","optimistic; planning; nonlinear; control; optimal; real-time; parallel","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2015-03-07","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","DCSC","","Signals & Systems","",""

To increase the diffraction limited resolution, the size of telescopes increases such as the to be build European Extremely Large Telescope (E-ELT). To fully benefit from the increased diffraction limited resolution, also the ability of adaptive optics to compensate for the wavefront aberrations should increase. This is for example done by increase the number of spatial wavefront measurements. This demands algorithms that are computationally efficient and highly parallelizable. In this thesis it is discussed whether the recently introduced Spline based ABeration REconstruction (SABRE) method can be parallelized. It is discussed that SABRE can be solved with the null-space method, resulting in a system of equations similar to the Poisson equation. The Conjugate Gradient (CG) method with different preconditioners, namely the Approximate INVerse (AINV), Algebraic Multigrid (AMG) and Incomplete Cholesky factorization (ICHOL), are used that make use of the sparsity of SABRE are discussed, their scalability and parallelism seem to be promising but the high amount of communication lowers the expectations. Experiments on the Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) give results, that matches with these expectations. Although there is plenty of parallelism, the sparse solvers are limited by the communication and therefore, for the grid sizes discussed in this thesis, slower than their counter ones on the Central Processing Unit (CPU). But there is lot of optimization possible and especially the CG with the AINV has a lot of potential.

(mentor); Vos, R. (mentor)","2014","The design of the landing gear is one of the prime aspects of aircraft design. Literature describes the design process thoroughly, however the integration of these design methods within an automated design framework has had little focus in literature. Landing gear design includes different engineering disciplines including structures, weights, kinematics, economics and runway design. Interaction between these different disciplines makes the landing gear a complex system. Automating the design process has shown to have the advantage of increased productivity, better support for design decisions and can provide the capability of collaborative and distributed design. The automation tools improve performance of current designs and simplify the development of new aircraft configurations. In this thesis a systematic and automated landing gear design procedure is proposed. Positioning the landing gear on the aircraft is limited by several requirements. Requirements include take-off stability, touchdown stability, wing-tip and engine clearance, ground handling and stability while taxiing. Evaluation of all these limits results in a feasible design space from which the shortest possible landing gear is found. From the resulting landing gear position, loads on the landing gear struts are calculated. Tyres and wheels are selected and brakes and shock absorbers are designed. The assembly of landing gear components can then be used to make an analytical weight estimation. This analytical weight estimation is based on maximum stresses occurring within the structure due to extreme load cases prescribed in certification specifications. Preventing yielding and buckling within the structure then results in required component thicknesses. A multi-body model is then made, where structural parts are seen as rigid bodies. The multi-body model evaluates and visualises the system dynamics. The oleo-pneumatic shock absorber forces and motion are modelled using an analytical relation. An empirical tyre model models tyre motion and forces at the contact point. These two models can accurately describe forces within the tyres and shocks due to externally applied forces, which then allows for the evaluation of extreme landing load cases. This is done to verify empirically estimated dynamic landing loads used in the weight estimation. And this is done to identify loading peaks that could occur during a landing. In addition to the landing simulation a simulation of the landing gear retraction mechanism is done to check the kinematic feasibility and compliance to certification requirements. Verification of results of the implemented landing gear with reference aircraft shows that landing gear positions closely match with actual landing gear positions. The analytical weight estimation of the landing gear assembly estimates the total gear weight with an error of 15 percent. This is comparable to the result of an empirical weight estimation that has an error of 17 percent. Multi-body simulation results show that dynamic loads during an extreme landing are similar to empirically estimated dynamic loads. For landing gears with multiple rows of tyres it is especially important to look at landing loads, since a hard landing then creates peaks at high frequency in the shock loads. These peaks originate from the interaction between front and rear axle tyres hitting the ground at different times. A kinematic simulation of retraction and extension then verifies the kinematic feasibility. This simulation also shows that the retraction and locking mechanisms work and that it can be stowed within the available space. The resulting landing gear design and analysis tools complete the existing aircraft design tools, which then forms the basis for the future improvement of automated transport aircraft design.","landing gear; aircraft design; structural analysis; class 2.5 weight estimation; component weight estimation; mdo; novel aircraft; initiator; automated design","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2014-03-26","Aerospace Engineering","Aerospace Design, Integration & Operations","","","",""

(mentor)","2014","After decades of coastal erosion in the north-west area of the Island of Texel, the shore-normal `Eierlandse Dam` had been built in 1995. The dam, situated in the outer delta of the Eierlandse Gat tidal inlet, resulted in a remarkable short-term morphological development of the adjacent coast. Four years following completion of the dam, large sedimentation rates were measured on both sides of the dam. On the updrift (south) side, sedimentation was predicted as a result of the blocked alongshore sediment transport. However, on the downdrift (north) side of the dam, no sedimentation was predicted. Today, almost two decades later, it remains unclear which processes contributed to the sediment accumulation on the north side of the dam. The increased functionalities and capabilities of the present-day modelling software enable a re-evaluation of the morphological processes around the dam in particular, and gain insights in the complex short-term morphodynamics in this area. To capture the driving mechanism(s) of the net sediment transport towards the northern area of the Eierlandse dam, the state-of-the-art process-based computational model Delft3D is applied. To investigate the influence of various conditions and processes on the morphological development around the dam, simulations are performed with various boundary conditions, model processes and formulations. After calibration of the model, one-year morphological predictions show large similarities with the observed bed level development at both sides of the dam. The ebb tidal currents seem responsible for the large amounts of sedimentation at the north side of the dam, predominantly during spring tides when flow velocities and tidal excursion increase. The ebb tidal channel `Robbengat` is located along the northern tip of the Island of Texel and curves from the inlet around the Eierlandse dam. The Robbengat channel has been eroding by strong ebb tidal currents since 1985. The eroded sediments of the channel are transported by the flow towards the outer delta. Before the channel curves, the flow is partly deflected towards the northern area of the Eierlandse dam. The flow enters a shallow area and decelerates, resulting in deposition of sediment. This conclusion rejects the conclusions drawn by previous studies regarding the same area, where complex hydrodynamics such as eddy forming and spiral flow in the channel bend were drawn as possible causes of the sedimentation.","Delft3D; coastal modeling; sediment; Eierland; Wadden Sea","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","","","53.183288, 4.840396"

(mentor); Jimenez Garcia, J.C. (mentor); Van den Boogaard, G.A. (mentor)","2014","In the Netherlands, almost one quarter of the children is overweight. (VUmc, 2012) This percentage keeps on rising. Overweight is expected to be the world’s largest health care problem in 2050. Children deserve special attention, since research by EPODE (Ensemble, Prévenons l’Obésité Des Enfants) shows that children that are overweight have a bigger chance of staying overweight throughout their life. For children who were overweight or obese prior to puberty, 20-50% will be overweight as an adult. This percentage rises to 50-70% for children who are overweight or obese during adolescence. (EPODE, 2013) This is a problem since overweight and obese children are more likely to develop diseases like diabetes and cardiovascular diseases at a younger age. For this reason, Masters that Matter, a foundation that creates solutions for the challenges our society faces, decided to launch a project in cooperation with Deelgemeente Rotterdam Noord and Ahold. The goal is to find a solution to prevent overweight in 9-12 year old children using a design approach. An interesting element found during research is the way children shape perception around food and drinks. For instance, energy drink and candy seem extremely cool. There is a range of factors underlying this behavior. Think of peer pressure, looking for a quick fix (in sugar), but also marketing. This combination of factors leads to a perceived product image, in which a bag of crisps is more cool and interesting than an apple. Research shows that mini-games around unhealthy foods persuade children to choose these foods more often in comparison to children who did not play these mini-games. This project builds upon this phenomenon and uses it in a positive way. Through participating in healthy mini-games, children are persuaded to choose a healthy food over an unhealthy alternatives. The mini-games are designed to be played after school. Every week a new product promotion, involving a new mini-game, is launched in the local supermarket. The designed games consist of a label (to label the food product) and an interactive website (giving instructions). The food products that are on promotion are labelled with a scratch of code. This scratch of code provides entrance to an interactive website. The design of both label and website trigger children’s curiosity. The web environment challenges children to execute the food mission. Social media is used as a means to built remembrance of the activity. The final design consists of 12 food missions. Some of these missions have been tested and evaluated with the target group (children aged 9-12). One mission is making a mustache from kiwi skin. This mission proved to have a fun-factor and stimulated children to eat kiwi. Most children respond positively to the design of the mini-game and online environment. The visual styling fits the target group well. User research has lead to a set of recommendations. Masters that Matter can implement these recommendations to uplift the concept to the next level. An important recommendation is to find a strategic partner that invests resources and develop a proof of concept. Further research is needed to prove that these mini-games indeed change the product image of everyday foods.","design; children; overweight; Masters that Matter","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Industrial Design","","Integrated Product Design","",""

(mentor); Albayrak, A. (mentor); Steegers-Theunissen, R.P.M. (mentor)","2014","This Master thesis describes the creation of Bebé: a design of an incentive for pregnant couples to live and eat healthy. This project was commissioned by the department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology of the Erasmus Medical Centre (MC) in Rotterdam, and executed as the final project of the Master Integrated Product Design at the Delft University of Technology. Each year around 200.000 women get pregnant in the Netherlands. At least 180.000 of those women, give birth to a living baby. Often, pregnant women and their partners are not aware of their responsibility for the unborn child during the first weeks of pregnancy. At that time, the baby does not move yet and there are little to none differences in external appearances of the mother. A healthy lifestyle and eating habits are very important during, and even before, pregnancy. The use of drugs and alcohol, smoking and experiencing stress can cause serious problems for the development of the unborn baby. The goal of this project was to come up with an incentive to pregnant couples to stimulate them and make them aware of a healthy lifestyle and eating habits. By creating the possibility for parents and caretakers to get a tangible product, providing them with a one to one 3D print of the embryo that is inside the mother's womb, an extra dimension was added to their pregnancy, as they can be more in touch with their baby and have an idea of the size, shape and appearance. Additive manufacturing, like 3D printing, is a technique that is very much upcoming. At this moment, 3D prints can be made from ultrasound or MRI scans. This opportunity – creating a 3D print from the data received by means of 3D ultrasound – served as the basis of this assignment. The process of getting from 3D ultrasound to 3D print was examined and different printing techniques, materials and machines were explored. To gain more knowledge into the products that are already offered during pregnancy and how couples are dealing with healthy lifestyle and eating habits, interviews were conducted with pregnant women and some of their partners. This study showed that many couples do not like the 3D ultrasound images that are offered. They even referred to it as ‘alien-like’. The idea of a 3D print was found to be more attractive. During the concept generation phase, a lot of ideas were generated, based on all information from the analysis phase. To receive the most out of it, multiple creative sessions were conducted with different people. By means of a small user evaluation at the end of this phase, the created concepts were ranked. This resulted in three final concepts, of which one was finally chosen to be developed further. This concept – Bebé – was further developed and embodied and a working prototype was made. During the embodiment phase, research was done on different shapes and materials. The functionality and usability of the product were tested during user tests with the prototype, after which recommendations were given. Bebé is a necklace that contains the embryo 3D print. The product protects the embryo 3D print that is inside by multiple layers and consists of 3 main parts: the embryo 3D print made out of plaster, making the pregnancy literally tangible, the necklace pendant, that can be worn around the neck of the expectant mother, and the necklace holder, in which the necklace can be stored or displayed when not being worn. These three parts together form a product that is conveying a greater message behind it: be responsible towards your unborn baby and make sure you live and eat healthy from the beginning of pregnancy onwards. Bebé is what you are doing it for.","3D printing; embryo; healthy lifestyle; responsibility; pregnancy; incentive; awareness","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Industrial Design","","Master of Science Integrated Product Design","",""

(mentor); Van der Meer, J.D. (mentor); Lamens, M. (mentor)","2014","Current approaches that deliver energy insight to customers are rather poor, data centric and incomprehensible. Driven by the vision to differently support customers in the transition towards new energy behavior, the Energy Game was developed. This service aims to guide customers in their journey towards a situation in which customers manage their own energy consumption and production. By applying the theory of Gamification, customers use their energy differently. This is a unique approach in the Energy Market, which is currently dominated by Energy Suppliers who supply their customers with incomprehensible and unusable products. Designing brings along the advantage of visually solving the complexity of a system. In case of a business model, this includes 4 characteristics: Stakeholders, a Value Network, the Profit Formula and the Value Proposition. These variables are found by the analysis of the Macro and Micro Market and the Macro and Micro Industry. The main insights are values which must be transferred between stakeholders in the business model, in order to match their needs. Furthermore it was found that relying on revenue solely generated by the end user is risky, and other income must be realized. After setting up the requirements through a context mapping session, the business model was created by performing 2 iterations of brainstorming with 3 co-designers. The results (24 variations) were clustered into 3 paying stakeholders: the Energy Supplier, a 3rd party in Marketing, and the Customer. These mains structures were used as an input for a last iteration. This resulted in 2 extra designs: the Platform model and the Virtual Store model. The three clusters and the 2 additional models were rated in a selection process. The result is a singular business model in which the Energy Game is presented to the user via a platform. The platform functions as a medium for both users and company to communicate through, and by which important values can be exchanged between stakeholders. Both B2C, as well as B2B revenue is generated. The business model best represents the transaction of the necessary values and is explained by means of corresponding product implications. Finally, the model is validated by means of a monetization and an implementation strategy on a tactical and organizational level. Tasks are determined and setup in a planning. Greeniant has to hire 4 developers for the development and testing of the game and 2 managers who arrange B2B deals and keep an overview over the tasks, planning and teams; a communications manager who sets up the communication with the customers and does the acquisition of new customers. The development team will develop the product iteratively using the Scrum methodology. Through thorough communication, both teams will develop the product and arrange revenue, and will create the product through validated learning. If successful, a new strategy can be setup for national and international launch. With these implications, it is assumed that this service in development can generate a yearly revenue of at least 360.000 per year from April 2014 and onwards.

Within its Primary department tobacco leaves are pretreated in such a way to meet the requirements for cigarette production, which is done in the Secondary department. Tobacco pretreatment processes are: cutting, adding moisture, sauces, semi-finished products and flavors. One of the semi-finished products is expanded tobacco. The aim of a expanded tobacco production process is to stretch the tobacco cells in order to create a permanent volume increase. Tobacco expansion within Philip Morris Holland B.V. is accomplished by means of the Dry Ice Expanded Tobacco technology. In several process steps tobacco cells get impregnated with liquid CO2, which together with the intercellular moisture reacts whereby CO2-hydrate forms. After a impregnation cycle has been completed, the tobacco cells are quickly heated to a temperature of 300ºC. Due to the temperature increase, the CO2-hydrate inside the tobacco cells disintegrates and causes enough gas, and as a result inner pressure, to stretch the cells to the desired volume. The hot expanded tobacco gets cooled down and finally moisture is added to meet the final product requirements. During the several process steps multiple tobacco waste flows, which consist of tobacco fines (dust), are separated from the main tobacco material flow.

(mentor)","2014","In the last decades shipping has increased significantly, resulting in larger ships with an increasing power in bow thrusters. Due to this increasing power, the hydraulic loads at bottom protection near quay structures has also increased, making a traditional bed protection more expensive. Therefore an alternative design method is suggested in which the bottom is not fully protected. As a result, scour could occur. The designer of the super structure should adapt his design on this scour. Consequently the total structure (bed protection and superstructure) could be designed more cost effective compared with the current design method of full bed protection. However, at this moment a method to predict scour at a sloping bed with piles affected by a bow thruster is not available, so it is impossible to apply the alternative design method. The objective of this master thesis is to set up a method to predict the equilibrium scour depth. In order to set up such a prediction method, a literature study was conducted. This literature study focused on the available knowledge of bow thruster induced currents and the effect of these currents on the instability and erosion of the bed material. The stability and mobility of the bed material depend on the ratio between flow forcing (flow velocities and turbulences) and the bed strength (particle size and density). When this ratio exceeds a critical value the bed is not stable anymore and transport will occur, leading to scour holes. Not only the thruster jet itself could induce scour formation, also the presence of a pile at the slope could lead to additional scouring. This is caused by the fact that a pile in a flow field causes differences in the flow field (local higher velocities and turbulence intensities). Consequently, extra scour is induced. This scour mechanism is called the pile obstruction mechanism. The total proposed equation consists of both the pile obstruction mechanism and the jet diffusion mechanism. The equation is validated for a horizontal bed. Due to absence of data for the sloping bed case the equation is not validated for the case of a slope yet. It is recommended to validate the proposed equation for the case of a slope with piles by conducting lab experiments.","scour; bow thrusters; stability; quay structure; bed protection","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2014-03-12","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","Hydraulic Engineering","",""

Speeding up neuron models, used in such experiments, facilitates faster testing of scientific hypotheses and faster model refinement in order to better replicate biological-cell behavior. To be able to simulate realistic behavior, high-detail neuron models need to be built which require a huge amount of computing power. Hardware acceleration can be used to minimize execution time of such simulations. However, building a hardware implementation is very time-consuming and error-prone. Recent trends in RTL design have resulted in tools which can convert a high-level behavioral hardware description to an RTL description targeting an FPGA, which makes them ideal tools for complex FPGA designs, such as high-detail neuron models. In this thesis, a model of the Inferior-Olivary Nucleus (ION) network has been implemented with synthesizable SystemC and mapped onto an FPGA using a High-Level Synthesis (HLS) tool-flow. A shared-bus architecture has been used to interconnect the various ION-cells in the modeled network. SystemC Transaction Level Modeling (TLM) facilitates fast network-interconnect modeling and verifying of model functionality. We have thus developed a SystemC TLM model that can predict trends of our RTL implementation. With this TLM model, we were able to quickly model large network sizes and assess the model’s scalability with respect to utilized resources and performance. The complete network model has, subsequently, also been synthesized. Xilinx Vivado HLS has been used to convert the SystemC implementation to an RTL description mapped on a Virtex 7 (XC7VX550T) FPGA device. The resulting design achieved a speed-up of 6 compared to a reference C model, making it possible to simulate a network of 48 cells in real-time. Because HLS tools are used, the model can be easily modified to accommodate last-minute changes and models updates by the neuroscientific community.","SystemC; FPGA; HLS; Neuroscience","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2014-03-04","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Microelectronics","","Circuits and Systems Group","",""

These are required to estimate how much energy a wind turbine will convert. The theoretical power curves are validated with measurements in test sites, however they may not be fully applicable in different wind climates as they are dependent on the site where, and the weather conditions when they were measured. The turbulence, and wind shear, connected to the atmospheric stability, are phenomena related to significant deviations in the power output expected from the power curves. They affect the energy available in the profile for conversion, and the actual conversion efficiency of the wind turbine. With actual data, distinguishing these changes is challenging, through simulations these factors could, however be relatively told apart from each other. The present work addressed the research question how these factors influence the estimation of power curves and investigated the methods to account for them in order to ultimately deliver more reliable power curves. Data from a flat, smooth, uniform test site in the Nether- lands and from a medium complexity site in Sweden was segregated by atmospheric stability, turbulence intensity, and shear, to generate regime-, turbulence-, and shear-dependent power curves to compare. The impact of these factors was observed, and it could be only till a certain degree accounted for. Bladed simulations were also employed to study the isolated effects of turbulence and shear; their influence in the power output was analysed and better results accounting for shear were achieved, turbulence for shear-less profiles was successfully accounted for with the proposal of a mixed correction. A correlation between the energy in the profile and the power output was found for the cases of shear and turbulence intensity. The concept of equivalent wind speed for wind resource assessment was analysed and the use of visualisation from LiDAR data to further understand the shear, TI, and stability at a test site was effectively explored as well.

(mentor); Van Keulen, A. (mentor)","2014","In this paper, a theoretical and numerical analysis is presented on the squeezed film between a circular rigid oscillating plate and a fixed proximity surface with an incompressible medium. A series of theoretical methods are derived or reviewed, such as lubrication theory from Reynolds (1886), Kuzma(1967), Ishizawa(1966), Beltman(1997) and Homotopy Perturbation Method(HPM) from He (1998). Numerical analysis is carried out using the Comsol package. A detailed comparison and discussion on the theoretical methods are based on the numerical results from the Comsol simulation. It is found that the hydrodynamic force is governed by the pure squeezing motion of the film height and the difference between the force on the top plate and the force on the bottom plate follows Newton's law. Dynamic models are built based on theoretical models for the mechanical applications.","squeezed film; normal oscillation; homotopy","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2019-03-03","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Precision and Microsystems Engineering","","","",""
