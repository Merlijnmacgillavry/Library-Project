The capacity of architecture to contribute towards towards such a state of being, is a major theme. The essay does this in three consecutive parts. In the first part, the subject\u2019s bodily experience of the world is laid out. It reveals how the body finds vibrant stimulation in the world. In the second part, the thoughtful understanding of the world is discussed. This reveals the subject\u2019s dependency on the mind for active sensibility. In the third and last part, a synthesis between one\u2019s active awareness and its bodily stimulation is presented. This leads to the embodiment of immanence. In this state of being, the turbulent world becomes a symphonic one. The subject may understand the felt, as well as that it may feel the understood. Clear and sharp appreciation of the world around becomes possible. As a part of this world, the subject is actively aware of its own presence too. Through this, one connects to its physical being and one is grounded inside the body and world. Architecture can help ground by revealing the relation between physical stimulation and the understanding that makes it sharp and clear. As a result, the symphony of the vibrant world is revealed, and the subject may dance along. Diving into the scene, the problems that Quincy mentioned related more to CV than to other hiring tools. Companies have to process the biggest number of applicants in the application stage since it is open to everyone. Therefore, applicants can only deliver written forms that recruiters screen in a few seconds without any communication. Because what they can tell is limited, and they never get feedback, applicants feel that they are not respected. The problem for companies is that they may miss the talents that are hard to identify in the application. Based on the given situation, the project\u2019s goal was determined: how to allow job seekers to self-represent in their CV.The project followed the double diamond design process. The first step was conducting desk research to explore the context, and the key takeaway from the desk research on the hiring process was seeing how different steps and recruitment tools are intertwined. The materials and tools are often used over multiple steps. Thus, the design direction for Hello Career was determined: a platform that covers the entire job searching journey supporting a seamless experience. Employees nowadays keep changing jobs which means the job searching journey keeps ongoing. The platform will help the users document their work-life regularly so that they can whenever start the job search in a prepared and constructive manner.Interviews and a creative session were conducted to discover the job seeker\u2019s needs for the main research focus, self-representation on CV, and each step of the journey. Converging techniques were used to bring the gathered ideas and insights into concrete ideas.The solution to the primary research goal was derived: an interactive online CV. A job seeker can form a bigger picture of who one is by connecting the experiences. Interactive elements and media content support delivering the story clearly. The CV would stay as an online page while being processed and screened. It would make the process transparent for applicants. The result highlights the job seeker\u2019s need for a platform that takes care of the entire job search journey and provides transparency in screening. By showing the potential of going online, the final design also suggests a new role for a CV.Due to the capacity, the project only focused on job seekers\u2019 perspectives and needs on the issue. Thus, further research and product iteration should take place to utilize the product. sensors or other low power applications like pacemakers. Huge savings in ecological footprint, production and maintenance costs can be achieved by replacing batteries for vibration energy harvesters. Most of the time, newly developed energy harvesters are tested in a lab environment on an electrodynamic shaker. The problem is that the standard lab experiments in the form of a sinusoidal or Gaussian noise signal excitation are not representative for the real world applications. In a classification of ambient vibrations it was observed that most vibrations found in the real world consist of a series of dominant frequencies, shocks and noise. It was also seen that among real world vibrations, there is a lot of variation in the power distribution among the classes. In the aim to bring the vibration energy harvester performance tests closer to the real world applications, an experimental benchmarking of energy harvester performance has been conducted. An energy harvester is designed and applied in the real world on the engine of two different cars. Successively, three different lab experiments are performed on an electrodynamic shaker, each experiment with its own type of vibration control. It is found that only taking the FFT data of a real world vibration is not sufficient. Using a sinusoidal excitation matching a single amplitude and frequency, or even a noise excitation matching the entire power spectrum, results in an under or overestimation of 50% compared to the real world performance. Therefore, to accurately predict the performance of an energy harvester in the real world, simulation or experimental testing need to be performed on the actual or a replication of the intended real world vibration."",""subject topic"":""Vibration energy harvesting; Electrodynamic shaker control; Real world vibrations; Vibration Analysis"",""language"":""en"",""publication type"":""master thesis"",""publisher"":null,""isbn"":null,""issn"":null,""patent"":null,""patent status"":null,""bibliographic note"":null,""access restriction"":null,""embargo date"":""2021-12-01"",""faculty"":null,""department"":null,""research group"":null,""programme"":""Mechanical Engineering | Precision and Microsystems Engineering"",""project"":null,""coordinates"":null},{""uuid"":""uuid:8304c8af-df26-4372-94fb-80b34a58a7ee"",""repository link"":""http:\/\/resolver.tudelft.nl\/uuid:8304c8af-df26-4372-94fb-80b34a58a7ee"",""title"":""Transplantable Urban Organs"",""author"":""Fajkovic, E."",""contributor"":""Biloria, N.M.

Het is daarom van groot belang dat het beheer van een webshop gebruiksvriendelijk en overzichtelijk is. In dit project was het de bedoeling dat er onderzoek gedaan werd naar een nieuw intu\u00c3\u00aftief systeem, dat voldoet aan de belangen van de webshop beheerder. Voor de ontwikkeling van het nieuwe webshop systeem is onderzocht wat de goede en de slechte kwaliteiten van huidige webshop aanbieders zoals Shopify, Wosbee en MijnWebwinkel zijn. Aan de hand van de kwaliteiten van deze huidige webshop aanbieders zijn er punten van verbetering opgesteld. Tijdens het ontwerp van het systeem zijn er scenario\u00e2s opgesteld aan de hand van het programma van eisen. Deze scenario's zijn omgezet in flowcharts. Daarna zijn er interface impressies met de hand uitgetekend, waarbij de flow van het systeem gevisualiseerd werd. Het systeem is ge\u00c3\u00afmplementeerd met de iteratief-prototyping werkwijze, waarbij elk onderdeel uitvoerig werd getest op gebruiksvriendelijkheid en zonodig aangepast voordat een nieuw onderdeel werd ge\u00c3\u00afmplementeerd. De webshop aanbieder Wosbee kwam op de laatste plaats in het kwaliteitsonderzoek. Het beheer van deze webshop is niet overzichtelijk en allerminst gebruiksvriendelijk; de webshop aanbieder scoorde een 5. De webshop aanbieder Shopify kwam als tweede uit de test; de webshop aanbieder scoorde een acceptabele 7,5. Mijnwebwinkel kwam als beste uit de test; deze webshop scoorde een 8. Het HellosSello systeem is met hetzelfde kwaliteitsonderzoek ge\u00c3\u00abvalueerd als de huidige webshop aanbieders. Deze evaluatie wees uit dat het HelloSello systeem gebruiksvriendelijk en overzichtelijk is; op deze punten scoorde het systeem een overtuigende 9. De reden dat het systeem gebruiksvriendelijk en overzichtelijk is, komt volgens de ondervraagden door het feit dat elke aanpassing direct zichtbaar is. De adminbalk, met daarin alle beheer mogelijkheden van de webshop, aan de onderkant van de pagina zorgt voor een eenvoudige en consistente manier van beheren, omdat de Shop eigenaar hetzelfde ziet als de Shop klant. Door de javascript libraries die zijn geleverd, is het in het vervolg heel makkelijk om nieuwe onderdelen te integreren in het beheer systeem. Dit zorgt ervoor dat elk onderdeel in dezelfde stijl beheerd kan worden. Het HelloSello systeem is dus makkelijk in het gebruik en uit het kwaliteitsonderzoek blijkt het systeem een significante verbetering te zijn ten opzichte van de huidige webshop aanbieders. Ook is het systeem makkelijk uit te breiden met meer webshop functionaliteit, mits er gebruik wordt gemaakt van de geleverde javascript libraries."",""subject topic"":""webshop"",""language"":""en"",""publication type"":""bachelor thesis"",""publisher"":""TU Delft, Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science, Information and Communication Technology (ICT)"",""isbn"":null,""issn"":null,""patent"":null,""patent status"":null,""bibliographic note"":null,""access restriction"":null,""embargo date"":null,""faculty"":""Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science"",""department"":null,""research group"":null,""programme"":null,""project"":null,""coordinates"":null},{""uuid"":""uuid:e340a020-ed07-4ab4-b0e1-a68bc373a2f1"",""repository link"":""http:\/\/resolver.tudelft.nl\/uuid:e340a020-ed07-4ab4-b0e1-a68bc373a2f1"",""title"":""Influence of shared information on predictability in human-agent teams"",""author"":""Nagy, Timea (TU Delft Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science; TU Delft Intelligent Systems)"",""contributor"":""Tielman, M.L.

When we look at the design process of an architect and a production designer, the two design processes look quite similar. Though, there are some important differences between the two, especially when we look at the first part of the design process. This is because an architect starts with an actual location and actual users he can refer to, while the production designer starts with a scenario which describes a narrative, characters and a fictive world. So how we can translate these stories into a design, without having any visual reference?

Furthermore, it implies that the model of the World Expo did not change over the past 150 years. So, the opportunity arose to develop an exposition of the world based on another model, for the sake of inclusion.The project took a position within decolonization theory, which is concerned with the disruption of any ideology of domination. At this point three guiding principles were articulated to lead the design: Interdependence, Multiplicity and Disruption. By using a design-based research method, the project developed from the interaction between theory and practice. In addition, it allowed two disciplines, Architecture and Science Communication, to consolidate in the course of the process.The design process resulted in Expo Mondo, a patio-pavilion located at numerous cities around the world, where it provides visitors a place to distance from everyday life. Facilitating both a place for self-reflection and an aesthetic experience. The architecture of Expo Mondo performs as a communication mean. This means that the architecture does not house an exhibition, but is the exposition itself. Expo Mondo aims to reveal unity in diversity, by exposing a context specific content through an universal architectural framework.The universal framework is made of the fundamental elements of architecture: the constructive elements. The patio-pavilion behaves autonomously in its context. In this way it allows itself to be familiar, and yet be distant to its surroundings. Furthermore, the framework takes a both\/and approach with regard to spatial opposites. This is determined to be an inclusive approach, because it does not prioritizes one over the other. Instead, the opposites co-exist in a mutual relationship. Expo Mondo concerns, among others, the co-existence of the man-made and the natural, the open and the enclosed, the classical and the neoplastic, the individual and the communal.Expo Mondo fosters diversity. The design triggers visitors to give multiple interpretations to Expo Mondo, and it allows different types of use. In this way it appeals to various individuals. Furthermore, the content - its nature, sculptures, and visitors - adapts to correspond to local conditions. Hence, the patio-pavilion fits the community and the climate in which it is implemented. As follows, it exposes the local culture. To leave room for interpretation the design of Expo Mondo is left open to some extend. The purpose of patio-pavilion is not mentioned in advance, only the name Expo Mondo is apparent. Additional information on the patio-pavilion can be looked up by visitors on the internet. Three focus groups were done to test the design of Expo Mondo. The participants represented three different groups of potential visitors. The results were related to the guiding principles of the design. The findings shows that the participants give different interpretations to Expo Mondo, and that not all intentions are recognized. Furthermore, this research has mapped the design process. In this way it provides insight on the integration of two disciplines, theory and practice in one research project. The design-based research method allowed for this integration to happen. The integration already started at an abstract level with the guiding principles. Lastly, the report concludes by answering main research question, interpreting the findings and discussing the limitations of the research.This master thesis is the result of a joint graduation project in partial fulfilment of my masters in Architecture and Science Communication, as part of a double degree master program at Delft University of Technology.

Furthermore, the framework takes a both\/and approach with regard to spatial opposites. This is determined to be an inclusive approach, because it does not prioritizes one over the other. Instead, the opposites co-exist in a mutual relationship. Expo Mondo concerns, among others, the co-existence of the man-made and the natural, the open and the enclosed, the classical and the neoplastic, the individual and the communal.Expo Mondo fosters diversity. The design triggers visitors to give multiple interpretations to Expo Mondo, and it allows different types of use. In this way it appeals to various individuals. Furthermore, the content - its nature, sculptures, and visitors - adapts to correspond to local conditions. Hence, the patio-pavilion fits the community and the climate in which it is implemented. As follows, it exposes the local culture. To leave room for interpretation the design of Expo Mondo is left open to some extend. The purpose of patio-pavilion is not mentioned in advance, only the name Expo Mondo is apparent. Additional information on the patio-pavilion can be looked up by visitors on the internet. Three focus groups were done to test the design of Expo Mondo. The participants represented three different groups of potential visitors. The results were related to the guiding principles of the design. The findings shows that the participants give different interpretations to Expo Mondo, and that not all intentions are recognized. Furthermore, this research has mapped the design process. In this way it provides insight on the integration of two disciplines, theory and practice in one research project.

It was identified that this phenomenon advertised a Western-centric perspective since its birth in 1851. This means that its way of representing the world excluded and marginalized others. Furthermore, it implies that the model of the World Expo did not change over the past 150 years. So, the opportunity arose to develop an exposition of the world based on another model, for the sake of inclusion.The project took a position within decolonization theory, which is concerned with the disruption of any ideology of domination. At this point three guiding principles were articulated to lead the design: Interdependence, Multiplicity and Disruption.

With the research question: \u2018To what extent is it possible to analyze irrigation water consumption in Central Asia using a locally developed model combined with open source remote sensing data?\u2019. Global open source data for evapotranspiration (ET), precipitation (P), areas equipped for irrigation and storage change are combined with outputs from the Aral Sea Basin management model (ASBmm). These are used to determine the actual irrigated areas, check the model data with water balances and calculate consumed fractions. The results show a trend of increasing CF with increasing irrigated area and larger CFs in downstream areas compared to upstream areas. It shows a big difference (40%) without and with complete reuse of upstream drainage water in downstream irrigated areas. These trends conform to the expectations. The second part of this study investigates why basin analysis is not structurally included in World Bank financed irrigation projects. Knowledge exchange is crucial for innovation and adopting new paradigms (Filieri et al., 2014; Walter et al., 2007). This is researched with the research question: \u00ab\\\u2019To what extent can a social capital analysis of knowledge exchange between academic hydrologists, World Bank staff and World Bank water and irrigation consultants aid the incorporation of the basin scale perspective on water consumption in World Bank financed irrigation projects?\u2019. The social capital perspective provides a systematic way to look at the dimensions of knowledge exchange in a social network (Adler and Kwon, 2002). The results from semi-structured interviews are compared to the conceptual framework which was deduced from a systematic literature review.One of the main obstacles in knowledge exchange and including basin analysis in World Bank financed irrigation projects is lack of time and resources. Proper basin analysis is not conducted because it is not a formal requirement. Additional issues are: ambiguity of the term efficiency, spatial distance between people and differences goals and perspectives within the Bank and between the Bank and client countries. Client countries are leading in project development and the moment the Bank has a background role. The application of basin scale analysis in World Bank financed irrigation projects should be formalized. This does not mean that investments in irrigation efficiency must stop, it means that a basin analysis is necessary to make an informed decision about that investment. while focusing on filling environments. Secondly, the assisted approach builds on the manual approach and is able to assist a designer in making the decisions necessary to fill environments. The manual approach uses a set of objects with explicit relationships, created following a modular approach. The manual approach incorporates a discrete and sequential timeline of events, with each event connected to a single location, directly into the process. Several actions are used to fill the narrative world for each point in time of the timeline. The assisted approach offers assistance for each decision of the actions. Due to computational complexity, each decision is assisted independently. The discrete decisions are evaluated and ordered through the use of weighted criteria. The continuous decisions, the placement of objects, requires generation of options, which is done through an adaptation of Merrell et al. [2011]\u2019s GPGPU algorithm. A usability study was conducted to test the effectiveness of the assisted approach compared to the manual approach. Results were collected through a creativity support index (CSI), a questionnaire on the assisted approach and quantitative measurements on object usage and time taken for actions and locations. The manual approach scored better in the CSI results than the assisted approach. The final questionnaire showed that this was caused by automation results not matching the user\u2019s expectations as these differ, at least, per user and location type. The following conclusions are made. First, explicit relationships allow direct insight in how objects interact. Secondly, the usability study results supports the iterative process employed by, both our, and many other creative process approaches. Finally, in general, it is difficult to provide valuable assistance as expectations differ greatly. The incorporation of uncertainty into the assistance can help lessen this problem."",""subject topic"":""Narrative world; Assistance; Automation; Environments"",""language"":""en"",""publication type"":""master thesis"",""publisher"":null,""isbn"":null,""issn"":null,""patent"":null,""patent status"":null,""bibliographic note"":null,""access restriction"":null,""embargo date"":null,""faculty"":null,""department"":null,""research group"":null,""programme"":null,""project"":null,""coordinates"":null},{""uuid"":""uuid:6a553506-5de6-48f0-adad-b174b6341c78"",""repository link"":""http:\/\/resolver.tudelft.nl\/uuid:6a553506-5de6-48f0-adad-b174b6341c78"",""title"":""Handling the unknown: Towards on-the-job object recognition"",""author"":""ter Kuile, David (TU Delft Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering)"",""contributor"":""Kober, J.

A large part of perceiving the environment is done through robot vision. Research in computer vision and machine learning lead to great improvements in the past decades and robots are able to outperform humans on certain tasks. However, these tasks are often in closed set condition. This makes translation to a real world application challenging, as this is in open set condition. The open set condition implies that incomplete knowledge of the world is available at training time. It is important for a robot, or agent, to be aware of this limitation. In vision tasks this is defined as open world recognition and allows an agent to detect and incrementally learn unknown objects. The key contributions of this report are an autonomous data collection protocol for synthetic data creation, the open world algorithm Learning to Accept Image Classes (L2AIC) and an on-the-job recognition approach that combines open world recognition with autonomous data collection. L2AIC is a deep meta-learning model that classifies objects by comparing it to its memory in an n-way k-shot manner. New classes can be incrementally added to the memory without needing to retrain the model. The autonomous data collection protocol consists of two steps. First, a 3D model is reconstructed from an unknown object with an RGB-D camera. Secondly, from this 3D model a synthetic dataset is created that is added to the memory of L2AIC. Results show that the on-the-job recognition approach is successful in learning to recognize a single unknown object using the L2AIC model with small-fc architecture an ResNet152 encoder. The encoder is loaded with pretrained weights on the ImageNet dataset. No additional fine-tuning is required, this has an adverse effect on the performance. Using the autonomous data collection protocol two datasets were created, varying the distance from the camera to the object. It was found that the synthetic dataset containing close-up images achieves the best performance. The performance of L2AIC with this closeup synthetic dataset is similar to using a dataset of actual images of the object. This means that for a single object it currently is not efficient to create a synthetic dataset. A more extensive study is required to compare performance of both datasets when increasing the number of encountered objects. Finally, the on-the-job approach shows it is capable of recognizing other instances of the same object class, using only the dataset of a single instance. This shows the on-the-job recognition approach is able to generalize well. Future work could be focused on improving this generalization with, for example, the help of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)."",""subject topic"":""machine learning; meta-learning; object recognition; open world learning; on-the-job learning; 3D reconstruction; Synthetic data"",""language"":""en"",""publication type"":""master thesis"",""publisher"":null,""isbn"":null,""issn"":null,""patent"":null,""patent status"":null,""bibliographic note"":null,""access restriction"":null,""embargo date"":null,""faculty"":null,""department"":null,""research group"":null,""programme"":""Mechanical Engineering"",""project"":null,""coordinates"":null},{""uuid"":""uuid:5722a0e7-e483-43f0-820b-f5f3ef8dd42e"",""repository link"":""http:\/\/resolver.tudelft.nl\/uuid:5722a0e7-e483-43f0-820b-f5f3ef8dd42e"",""title"":""Look, who is talking?"",""author"":""Visee, C.E."",""contributor"":""Visch, V.T.

Feeling immersed in a simulation is assumed to positively influence learning. Immersion is related to aspects like experiencing Presence and Involvement in the virtual environment. Realness of and interaction with the virtual environment can generate the feeling of Immersion. For a training of Fire Crew Commanders (FCC) the communication between the trainee and the instructor who is physically present, plays an important role. Trainees find themselves dividing their attention between the virtual and the real world. Objective The objective of this study is to research the influence of a different method of communication with the instructor on the experience of Immersion of a FCC during his training, by integrating the instructor\u2019s role-play into the virtual environment (One World; virtual and real world aligned). Research Questions The primary research question of this thesis is: can the immersive experience of a Fire Crew Commander during simulation training with XVR be improved by integrating communication through role-play with the Virtual World to experience Immersion in One World? The secondary research question elaborates on this new manner of training with integrated communication: what are the effects of various ways of enriching communication between the Fire Crew Commander and the virtual characters in this newly created One World on the experience of Immersion of the Fire Crew Commander? Methods The immersive experience of a total of 27 Dutch Fire Crew Commanders was measured by a questionnaire and by post-experimental interviews. The current training situation and four situations with an instructor integrated in the virtual environment and manipulations of the communication were tested. The questionnaire measured the concepts of Communication, Spatial Presence, Involvement, Realness and Co-Presence. The interview gathered the Fire Crew Commanders\u2019 experience of the different conditions. Results The immersive experience of Fire Crew Commanders was not influenced by the position the instructor had during role-play. An auditory cue (different voice) and a visual cue (speech balloon) were experienced to be beneficial for giving orders in the virtual environment. An effect of the cues on the feeling of Immersion in the virtual environment was not revealed. However, an ANOVA (statistical test) revealed that an instructor who is integrated in the virtual environment in combination with visual and auditory cues has a positive effect on experiencing giving orders in the virtual environment. Conclusions and Discussion For Serious Games, which train decisiveness and leadership abilities, the position of the instructor has no impact on the immersive experience of the trainee. This implies that the learning effect will be equal with or without an instructor who is physically present, assuming that Immersion influences learning. Visual and auditory cues can be supportive in creating a better understanding and control of the training scenario. For E-Semble this means that remote learning could be offered alongside the current training form. Also, integration of visual or auditory cues are supportive in understanding the scenario more easily; this sympathises with an XVR learning objective."",""subject topic"":""virtual simulation training; immersive experience"",""language"":""en"",""publication type"":""master thesis"",""publisher"":null,""isbn"":null,""issn"":null,""patent"":null,""patent status"":null,""bibliographic note"":null,""access restriction"":""Campus only"",""embargo date"":null,""faculty"":""Industrial Design Engineering"",""department"":""Industrial Design"",""research group"":null,""programme"":""Master of Science Design for Interaction"",""project"":null,""coordinates"":null},{""uuid"":""uuid:240266ee-a4f4-4926-b3dc-005b4c5b68f1"",""repository link"":""http:\/\/resolver.tudelft.nl\/uuid:240266ee-a4f4-4926-b3dc-005b4c5b68f1"",""title"":""Hello neighbors!

He organized the project brief that aims to develop ideas for an online job-matching platform that brings healthy changes to the hiring process. He gave a working title for the platform called HelloCareer. Quincy\u2019s focus was on addressing the issues around bias and communication gaps in hiring and giving autonomy over self-representation to job seekers - their ability to choose and control how they communicate their skills, motivation, personality, and experience.Diving into the scene, the problems that Quincy mentioned related more to CV than to other hiring tools. Companies have to process the biggest number of applicants in the application stage since it is open to everyone. Therefore, applicants can only deliver written forms that recruiters screen in a few seconds without any communication. Because what they can tell is limited, and they never get feedback, applicants feel that they are not respected. The problem for companies is that they may miss the talents that are hard to identify in the application. Based on the given situation, the project\u2019s goal was determined: how to allow job seekers to self-represent in their CV.The project followed the double diamond design process. The first step was conducting desk research to explore the context, and the key takeaway from the desk research on the hiring process was seeing how different steps and recruitment tools are intertwined. The materials and tools are often used over multiple steps. Thus, the design direction for Hello Career was determined: a platform that covers the entire job searching journey supporting a seamless experience. Employees nowadays keep changing jobs which means the job searching journey keeps ongoing. The platform will help the users document their work-life regularly so that they can whenever start the job search in a prepared and constructive manner.Interviews and a creative session were conducted to discover the job seeker\u2019s needs for the main research focus, self-representation on CV, and each step of the journey. Converging techniques were used to bring the gathered ideas and insights into concrete ideas.The solution to the primary research goal was derived: an interactive online CV. A job seeker can form a bigger picture of who one is by connecting the experiences. Interactive elements and media content support delivering the story clearly. The CV would stay as an online page while being processed and screened. It would make the process transparent for applicants. The result highlights the job seeker\u2019s need for a platform that takes care of the entire job search journey and provides transparency in screening. By showing the potential of going online, the final design also suggests a new role for a CV.Due to the capacity, the project only focused on job seekers\u2019 perspectives and needs on the issue. Thus, further research and product iteration should take place to utilize the product. sensors or other low power applications like pacemakers. Huge savings in ecological footprint, production and maintenance costs can be achieved by replacing batteries for vibration energy harvesters. Most of the time, newly developed energy harvesters are tested in a lab environment on an electrodynamic shaker. The problem is that the standard lab experiments in the form of a sinusoidal or Gaussian noise signal excitation are not representative for the real world applications. In a classification of ambient vibrations it was observed that most vibrations found in the real world consist of a series of dominant frequencies, shocks and noise. It was also seen that among real world vibrations, there is a lot of variation in the power distribution among the classes. In the aim to bring the vibration energy harvester performance tests closer to the real world applications, an experimental benchmarking of energy harvester performance has been conducted. An energy harvester is designed and applied in the real world on the engine of two different cars. Successively, three different lab experiments are performed on an electrodynamic shaker, each experiment with its own type of vibration control. It is found that only taking the FFT data of a real world vibration is not sufficient. Using a sinusoidal excitation matching a single amplitude and frequency, or even a noise excitation matching the entire power spectrum, results in an under or overestimation of 50% compared to the real world performance. Therefore, to accurately predict the performance of an energy harvester in the real world, simulation or experimental testing need to be performed on the actual or a replication of the intended real world vibration."",""subject topic"":""Vibration energy harvesting; Electrodynamic shaker control; Real world vibrations; Vibration Analysis"",""language"":""en"",""publication type"":""master thesis"",""publisher"":null,""isbn"":null,""issn"":null,""patent"":null,""patent status"":null,""bibliographic note"":null,""access restriction"":null,""embargo date"":""2021-12-01"",""faculty"":null,""department"":null,""research group"":null,""programme"":""Mechanical Engineering | Precision and Microsystems Engineering"",""project"":null,""coordinates"":null},{""uuid"":""uuid:8304c8af-df26-4372-94fb-80b34a58a7ee"",""repository link"":""http:\/\/resolver.tudelft.nl\/uuid:8304c8af-df26-4372-94fb-80b34a58a7ee"",""title"":""Transplantable Urban Organs"",""author"":""Fajkovic, E."",""contributor"":""Biloria, N.M.

Het is daarom van groot belang dat het beheer van een webshop gebruiksvriendelijk en overzichtelijk is. In dit project was het de bedoeling dat er onderzoek gedaan werd naar een nieuw intu\u00c3\u00aftief systeem, dat voldoet aan de belangen van de webshop beheerder. Voor de ontwikkeling van het nieuwe webshop systeem is onderzocht wat de goede en de slechte kwaliteiten van huidige webshop aanbieders zoals Shopify, Wosbee en MijnWebwinkel zijn. Aan de hand van de kwaliteiten van deze huidige webshop aanbieders zijn er punten van verbetering opgesteld. Tijdens het ontwerp van het systeem zijn er scenario\u00e2s opgesteld aan de hand van het programma van eisen. Deze scenario's zijn omgezet in flowcharts. Daarna zijn er interface impressies met de hand uitgetekend, waarbij de flow van het systeem gevisualiseerd werd. Het systeem is ge\u00c3\u00afmplementeerd met de iteratief-prototyping werkwijze, waarbij elk onderdeel uitvoerig werd getest op gebruiksvriendelijkheid en zonodig aangepast voordat een nieuw onderdeel werd ge\u00c3\u00afmplementeerd. De webshop aanbieder Wosbee kwam op de laatste plaats in het kwaliteitsonderzoek. Het beheer van deze webshop is niet overzichtelijk en allerminst gebruiksvriendelijk; de webshop aanbieder scoorde een 5. De webshop aanbieder Shopify kwam als tweede uit de test; de webshop aanbieder scoorde een acceptabele 7,5. Mijnwebwinkel kwam als beste uit de test; deze webshop scoorde een 8. Het HellosSello systeem is met hetzelfde kwaliteitsonderzoek ge\u00c3\u00abvalueerd als de huidige webshop aanbieders. Deze evaluatie wees uit dat het HelloSello systeem gebruiksvriendelijk en overzichtelijk is; op deze punten scoorde het systeem een overtuigende 9. De reden dat het systeem gebruiksvriendelijk en overzichtelijk is, komt volgens de ondervraagden door het feit dat elke aanpassing direct zichtbaar is. De adminbalk, met daarin alle beheer mogelijkheden van de webshop, aan de onderkant van de pagina zorgt voor een eenvoudige en consistente manier van beheren, omdat de Shop eigenaar hetzelfde ziet als de Shop klant. Door de javascript libraries die zijn geleverd, is het in het vervolg heel makkelijk om nieuwe onderdelen te integreren in het beheer systeem. Dit zorgt ervoor dat elk onderdeel in dezelfde stijl beheerd kan worden. Het HelloSello systeem is dus makkelijk in het gebruik en uit het kwaliteitsonderzoek blijkt het systeem een significante verbetering te zijn ten opzichte van de huidige webshop aanbieders. Ook is het systeem makkelijk uit te breiden met meer webshop functionaliteit, mits er gebruik wordt gemaakt van de geleverde javascript libraries."",""subject topic"":""webshop"",""language"":""en"",""publication type"":""bachelor thesis"",""publisher"":""TU Delft, Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science, Information and Communication Technology (ICT)"",""isbn"":null,""issn"":null,""patent"":null,""patent status"":null,""bibliographic note"":null,""access restriction"":null,""embargo date"":null,""faculty"":""Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science"",""department"":null,""research group"":null,""programme"":null,""project"":null,""coordinates"":null},{""uuid"":""uuid:e340a020-ed07-4ab4-b0e1-a68bc373a2f1"",""repository link"":""http:\/\/resolver.tudelft.nl\/uuid:e340a020-ed07-4ab4-b0e1-a68bc373a2f1"",""title"":""Influence of shared information on predictability in human-agent teams"",""author"":""Nagy, Timea (TU Delft Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science; TU Delft Intelligent Systems)"",""contributor"":""Tielman, M.L.

When we look at the design process of an architect and a production designer, the two design processes look quite similar. Though, there are some important differences between the two, especially when we look at the first part of the design process. This is because an architect starts with an actual location and actual users he can refer to, while the production designer starts with a scenario which describes a narrative, characters and a fictive world.

It was identified that this phenomenon advertised a Western-centric perspective since its birth in 1851. This means that its way of representing the world excluded and marginalized others. Furthermore, it implies that the model of the World Expo did not change over the past 150 years. So, the opportunity arose to develop an exposition of the world based on another model, for the sake of inclusion.The project took a position within decolonization theory, which is concerned with the disruption of any ideology of domination. At this point three guiding principles were articulated to lead the design: Interdependence, Multiplicity and Disruption. By using a design-based research method, the project developed from the interaction between theory and practice. In addition, it allowed two disciplines, Architecture and Science Communication, to consolidate in the course of the process.The design process resulted in Expo Mondo, a patio-pavilion located at numerous cities around the world, where it provides visitors a place to distance from everyday life. Facilitating both a place for self-reflection and an aesthetic experience. The architecture of Expo Mondo performs as a communication mean. This means that the architecture does not house an exhibition, but is the exposition itself. Expo Mondo aims to reveal unity in diversity, by exposing a context specific content through an universal architectural framework.The universal framework is made of the fundamental elements of architecture: the constructive elements. The patio-pavilion behaves autonomously in its context. In this way it allows itself to be familiar, and yet be distant to its surroundings. Furthermore, the framework takes a both\/and approach with regard to spatial opposites. This is determined to be an inclusive approach, because it does not prioritizes one over the other. Instead, the opposites co-exist in a mutual relationship. Expo Mondo concerns, among others, the co-existence of the man-made and the natural, the open and the enclosed, the classical and the neoplastic, the individual and the communal.Expo Mondo fosters diversity. The design triggers visitors to give multiple interpretations to Expo Mondo, and it allows different types of use. In this way it appeals to various individuals. Furthermore, the content - its nature, sculptures, and visitors - adapts to correspond to local conditions. Hence, the patio-pavilion fits the community and the climate in which it is implemented. As follows, it exposes the local culture. To leave room for interpretation the design of Expo Mondo is left open to some extend. The purpose of patio-pavilion is not mentioned in advance, only the name Expo Mondo is apparent. Additional information on the patio-pavilion can be looked up by visitors on the internet. Three focus groups were done to test the design of Expo Mondo. The participants represented three different groups of potential visitors. The results were related to the guiding principles of the design. The findings shows that the participants give different interpretations to Expo Mondo, and that not all intentions are recognized. Furthermore, this research has mapped the design process. In this way it provides insight on the integration of two disciplines, theory and practice in one research project. The design-based research method allowed for this integration to happen. The integration already started at an abstract level with the guiding principles. Lastly, the report concludes by answering main research question, interpreting the findings and discussing the limitations of the research.This master thesis is the result of a joint graduation project in partial fulfilment of my masters in Architecture and Science Communication, as part of a double degree master program at Delft University of Technology.

However, the IR community is now facing the issue of overusing the weak baselines. Thus, it is hard for researchers to identify the reported improvement of the newly-proposed methods, which greatly impedes the development of the community. Some researchers have already proposed several competitive baselines for ad-hoc retrieval task, but currently, the proposals of strong baselines for question retrieval are still not enough. Thus, this work targets on identifying the suitable baselines for question retrieval task on different datasets. We conduct an empirical comparison among different retrieval models on two representative datasets and analyze the performance of models on different question sets. Analyzing on CQA questions is challenging since the CQA questions are more diverse and complex, compared to the questions on traditional question answering (QA) (e.g., Wikipedia) system as well as the queries on traditional search engine (e.g., Google). Our work investigates the impact of the question from two perspectives. We first display how retrieval performance changes on various question sets (e.g., questions with different lengths and different levels of specificity) and then explain the reasons for the performance changes. Moreover, we conduct an error analysis to reveal the hard types of questions for different retrieval models on two datasets. In order to overcome the existing weakness of the retrieval models, we further select two techniques that have already proven effective in other retrieval tasks. We hypothesize that the two techniques can also be useful on question retrieval task. We then implement the two techniques on our datasets to validate the hypothesis. Our findings show that one of them can not help to enhance the retrieval effectiveness of models due to the different characteristics of task design while another technique successfully demonstrates the additive effectiveness gains. Based on our findings, we find out the suitable baseline models on different datasets as well as emphasize their relative strength and limitation. We believe our work can provide useful guidance on how to select an appropriate baseline for future works on question retrieval."",""subject topic"":""Community Question Answering; Baseline Selection; Question Retrieval"",""language"":""en"",""publication type"":""master thesis"",""publisher"":null,""isbn"":null,""issn"":null,""patent"":null,""patent status"":null,""bibliographic note"":null,""access restriction"":null,""embargo date"":null,""faculty"":null,""department"":null,""research group"":null,""programme"":null,""project"":null,""coordinates"":null},{""uuid"":""uuid:c12585aa-d58d-49d9-b294-571a4023620b"",""repository link"":""http:\/\/resolver.tudelft.nl\/uuid:c12585aa-d58d-49d9-b294-571a4023620b"",""title"":""Towards better understanding of cover song retrieval: A modular evaluation of system choices"",""author"":""Liem, C.C.S."",""contributor"":""Hanjalic, A.

The problem is considered in the context of content-based audio retrieval. In order to gain more insight into the current state-of-the art in cover song retrieval research, several existing approaches to cover song retrieval are studied in a modular way. Modules from different approaches are systematically recombined and each resulting combination is tested on several designated datasets. The modules have been chosen such that they reflect general and independent system decisions, while the datasets were constructed to each pose a specific and known subset of the broad range of cover song types and similarity challenges. For the experiments that are carried out, we depart from cover song system combinations that use the conventional approach of representing songs as absolute chroma vectors over time. Additionally, we transform these representations into a statistical meta-representation and also study the influences of using relative first-order time-differential information. In the results obtained, several critical choices in system modules influencing the overall performance can be identified. Our work is presented by first discussing the cover song retrieval problem in a top-down way, starting from the general musical and technical issues posed that form the inspiration for our choice of considered system modules. Subsequently, we continue by discussing the existing approaches that were studied in more detail. After explaining our experimental setup and evaluation methodology, the results of our work are presented. Finally, considering the results of our work, several suggestions for future directions in cover song retrieval research are made that especially focus at gaining more understanding in the relation between high-level aspects and technical solutions."",""subject topic"":""cover song retrieval; content-based audio similarity; music information retrieval"",""language"":""en"",""publication type"":""master thesis"",""publisher"":null,""isbn"":null,""issn"":null,""patent"":null,""patent status"":null,""bibliographic note"":null,""access restriction"":null,""embargo date"":null,""faculty"":""Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science"",""department"":""Mediamatics"",""research group"":null,""programme"":null,""project"":null,""coordinates"":null},{""uuid"":""uuid:de8abdb6-2038-4fba-90fd-13667abdd930"",""repository link"":""http:\/\/resolver.tudelft.nl\/uuid:de8abdb6-2038-4fba-90fd-13667abdd930"",""title"":""Feature Fusion for Efficient Content-Based Video Retrieval"",""author"":""Visser, M."",""contributor"":""Van der Maaten, J.P.

The steepness of bench, interramp and resulting overall slope angles have a direct effect on the stripping ratio, therefore on the profitability of the mining operation. With the recently challenging metal prices in mind, the maximization of slope angles is even more important nowadays, prompting detailed investigations in the topic. The primary goal of this master thesis is to provide updated rock mechanical design criteria for the Liikavaara \u00d6stra open pit in Northern Sweden, by collecting and assessing the already available information from the area, as well as evaluating the raw data of the drilling campaign undertaken in 2016. After the compilation of the rock mechanical and geological data of the site, the bench scale slope stability was assessed with probabilistic and deterministic approach. During the process, two failure criteria (Mohr-Coulomb and Barton-Bandis) and two groundwater conditions (drained and undrained) were tested. Based on the gained experience in the neighbouring Aitik mine, the drained Barton-Bandis scenario was used both in probabilistic and deterministic approach to recommend bench face angles. Based on the findings of the bench slope analysis, an increase of the bench and interramp angles (compared to the previous design study) is possible, with the presumption of improved smooth blasting techniques and minimized back break. In identified areas with excessively poor rock quality, the application of external rock support was assessed in order to maintain reasonable bench angles and avoid mining of additional waste rock. The application of external slope support practices deemed feasible in the footwall domains of the pit, where with the utilization of support methods, the possible relocation of the E10 road can be avoided. The overall slope stability was also assessed in the footwall with limit equilibrium analysis methods. The footwall of the pit was found to be stable with the new design criteria, although it is sensitive to the presence of groundwater pressures. The master thesis was conducted as part of the European Mining, Minerals and Environmental Program (EMMEP), European Mining Course (EMC) track.

Creating it underground is an option, but this may be socially unfeasible, considering for example risks with respect to conservation of historical architecture. Besides, the presence of cars in city centres is socially becoming more undesirable. However, city centres are to be accessible as much possible. Creating parking spaces under water with a good connection to an urban environment or adjacent to an urban environment might be an option to solve this paradox. Considering the problem in general, the question is: Is it technically feasible to build a parking garage under water? Besides, an investigation into the costs of such a parking garage needs to be done. Investments in under water parking garages will only be made if costs are retrieved or, better, if there is a potential for profit. Considering this, the question is: Is it economically feasible to build a parking garage under a river? First, a description is given of the operational process in parking garages in general. Taking the main aspects of the operational process into account, an optimal configuration of parking space in the interior parking floor has been obtained. This forms the base of the interior garage design. Several construction methods have been taken into consideration for realization of parking space under water. Consequently, for one construction method the feasibility has been investigated. Construction of prefab tunnel alike elements to be immersed for the purpose of parking space seems an option. Since this is an innovative concept, this method was chosen for further investigation. Therefore, a case study has been carried out. The designs made for feasibility have been based on global dimensioning. Based on this global dimensioning, realizing a parking structure under water appears to be technically feasible in general. Based on global dimensions, realizing a parking structure under water in Beverwijk does not appear to be economically feasible for a ( wished) parking tarriff of 1,50 per hour. The designed garage appears to be feasible with a parking tarriff of at least 1,86 (in 2008). It is to be doubted that a parking tarriff of 1,86 is accepted in Beverwijk, so in Beverwijk the designed garage seems not to be feasible. In larger cities, a tarriff of 1,86 would be commonly accepted in 2008, so for larger cities in the Netherlands the concept is economically feasible."",""subject topic"":""parking under water is feasible"",""language"":""en"",""publication type"":""master thesis"",""publisher"":""TU Delft, Civil Engineering and Geosciences, Hydraulic Engineering"",""isbn"":null,""issn"":null,""patent"":null,""patent status"":null,""bibliographic note"":null,""access restriction"":null,""embargo date"":null,""faculty"":""Civil Engineering and Geosciences"",""department"":null,""research group"":null,""programme"":null,""project"":null,""coordinates"":null},{""uuid"":""uuid:3bb28fad-30bc-46ec-8e26-f5b1c6e76678"",""repository link"":""http:\/\/resolver.tudelft.nl\/uuid:3bb28fad-30bc-46ec-8e26-f5b1c6e76678"",""title"":""How information flows can be enhanced within construction projects within construction companies"",""author"":""Oorschot, Tom (TU Delft Civil Engineering and Geosciences)"",""contributor"":""Bosch-Rekveldt, M.G.C.

Multiple recent studies state that enhancing the information flows can result in a better functioning organisation.Research descriptionThe information flow between the different layers of an organisation is of high importance. A distinction can be made between formal and informal information flows. Controlling a large organisation, the formal information holds a very dominant and strong position when it comes to information flows. Nevertheless, formal information does not always deliver the managers of the organisation the right information to establish proper coordination and strategy. Conjoining the process of acquiring information informally and the formal information systems of organisations has not been successful so far. The literature indicates that strategies and the way of coordinating an organisation should be based on both the formal and informal information, but chances are that the formal information instruments dominate the informal information. Hollandia Infra believes that there is room for improvement on how to cope with their information flows. The research question formulated in order to help to reflect upon this matter is:\u2018How can information flows be enhanced in construction projects within a construction company?\u2019To answer this question a literature study is conducted to investigate the current theoretical role of information flows in intrafirm supply chains of construction projects. Afterwards a case study has been conducted at the construction company of Hollandia Infra. As part of this case study the intended information flow is studied by conducting a company document study. A Social Network Analysis is carried out in order to understand how the actual information flow functions. The intended and actual information flows are compared. Identified differences are explained by interviewing those involved. To understand the role information flows play in the organisation. The interview findings result in managerial implications which aim to support efforts to enhance the information flows. These managerial implications are validated by interviewing two experts. Theoretical role of information flowsInformation flows can be divided into formal and informal information flows. Formal information flows concern information that is less dependent on individual information holders. This form of information flows is easier to regulate, using IT systems for instance, than informal information flows. The informal information flow is very dependent on the individual information holder and his\/her willingness to share information. The focus of organisations is mainly on the transfer of formal information as organisations aim to provide and produce generic information and guidelines that employees can use to work with. This results in informal information flows playing a background role, while this form of information is of strategical added value. Intended and actual information flowBy carrying out a company document study, the primary process of Hollandia Infra during the construction phase was studied in-depth. Understanding and visualising the workflow and what the function of the different actors in the primary process is, has led to the disclosure of the relationships and the associated information flow. Based on the process schemes of Hollandia Infra it can be assumed who is in contact with whom and thus how the information is intended to flow through the organisation\u2026The Damper Division of ZF Friedrichshafen AG (case company), Schweinfurt (SCW) has recently decided to move the production ofits high running parts to its facility in Pune, India. The project is facing typical Supply Chain Management challenges like delay in serial production and delivery schedules, lack of information exchange, ambiguity over roles and responsibilities, and redundant communication between the two facilities SCW and Pune, thus incurring a high transaction cost and low coordination. The literature review about information flows, business processes and process integration provided four principles that help to integrate the information flow between processes. These principles are \u2013 accessibility, transparency, granularity, and timeliness. The analysis pointed that there are information gaps and interrelationship issuesbetween the stakeholders of the project. The issues identified were the need for an information exchange map which can be relied on by all of the stakeholders, timely information exchange, defined responsibilities and roles, and efficient communication. Standardization of information exchange with the help information exchange map together with information sharing rules emerged out as the main conceptual design. This was followed by a participatory design phase where the design was developed together with the stakeholders of the project.Based on the final design with information sharing rules (meeting structure and ground rules), a set of recommendations (including an implementation plan) were laid out to help the managers steer the final design to the best of their use. Currently, the case company is about to implement the design together with the meeting structure and ground rules. It was recommended that the future objective of the company should be to achieve a control tower for central data collection and using the data to generate insights."",""subject topic"":""Information Exchange; Information Flows; Coordination; Supply Chain; Process Integration"",""language"":""en"",""publication type"":""master thesis"",""publisher"":null,""isbn"":null,""issn"":null,""patent"":null,""patent status"":null,""bibliographic note"":null,""access restriction"":null,""embargo date"":""2021-08-31"",""faculty"":null,""department"":null,""research group"":null,""programme"":null,""project"":null,""coordinates"":""50.026610""},{""uuid"":""uuid:78a12359-a9a9-4b65-8e8f-83aeae8b8939"",""repository link"":""http:\/\/resolver.tudelft.nl\/uuid:78a12359-a9a9-4b65-8e8f-83aeae8b8939"",""title"":""The relation between the organizational information security climate and employees\u2019 information security behavior"",""author"":""Timmermans, Jan (TU Delft Technology, Policy and Management)"",""contributor"":""van Eeten, Michel (mentor); Pieters, Wolter (mentor); Kroesen, Maarten (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)"",""publication year"":2018,""abstract"":""Employees are often referred to as the main cause of cyber security incidents in organizations.

Existing literature concentrates on addressing this challenge, by focusing on a single aspect of information management rather than providing a comprehensive picture of all the procedures, parties engaged, information, formats and platforms used as well as their interdependencies. Therefore, the objective of this graduation research is to determine the workflows for information management to allow digitization across the whole lifecycle, by examining multiple aspects.

The main processes identified during each project stage concern the production of information deliverables by the respective party, using the suitable format. As both geometrical and non-geometrical information is generated during the different project stages, different formats are used, i.e. information models and documentation. Subsequently and at the end of each stage, the respective information is shared to other parties during specific information exchange moments. A collaborative environment is used by the different parties, both during the production and information sharing. Concluding, as digital transformation becomes even more widespread, a growing number of organizations strive for effective information management.

Most of the public infrastructure assets\u2019 condition nowadays deteriorate due to ageing and municipalities confront challenges to manage their portfolios effectively by adopting proactive management strategies. To succeed the highest possible value from assets, asset management is being adopted as an industry practice in the Dutch construction sector. Successfully managing assets requires managers at the handover stage to acquire accurate, explicit, and complete information from the earlier stages (Design and Construction phase). Only with reliable information they can make the right decisions about costs, performance, and risks which are the pillars of asset management theory. However, the information in the operations stage is incomplete or invalid and dispersed in various sources. This is an obstacle to reuse knowledge as asset managers have to identify information from various sources leading to secondary costs. Significant barriers are the asset managers' limited involvement from the project's beginning. That makes their needs less explicit for contractors and reduces the level of understanding of what information they have to deliver. This thesis works towards providing a more reusable and flexible method in the construction industry for capturing and structuring the strategic information needs of asset managers in a machine and human-understandable way. Linked data and semantic web technologies were used to capture and structure the information and create an ontology. In conclusion, the research demonstrated a way of identifying, capturing and structuring asset information needs with which users can communicate effectively using a common language. The ontology aggregates and stores information from diverse sources and enhance the communication between parties by providing them a common understanding given the specific scope. In this way, the information needs of asset managers can be explicitly defined from the beginning of a project, resulting to complete and reusable information. Now the understanding of what information has to be transferred to asset managers is more straightforward, reusable and unambiguous, resulting in reduced time retrieval of information and secondary costs (e.g. looking for information)."",""subject topic"":""Asset management; Public Sewerage Systems; Information Technology; Knowledge Management"",""language"":""en"",""publication type"":""master thesis"",""publisher"":null,""isbn"":null,""issn"":null,""patent"":null,""patent status"":null,""bibliographic note"":null,""access restriction"":null,""embargo date"":null,""faculty"":null,""department"":null,""research group"":null,""programme"":""Civil Engineering | Construction Management and Engineering"",""project"":null,""coordinates"":null},{""uuid"":""uuid:bb2314c8-9bf8-4141-bc3d-050a784b65ca"",""repository link"":""http:\/\/resolver.tudelft.nl\/uuid:bb2314c8-9bf8-4141-bc3d-050a784b65ca"",""title"":""Finding a balance between meaningful and useful participation by improving information provision: Assessing the effectiveness of information provision approaches in participatory value evaluation on empowering participants to give informed input on urban climate adaptation projects"",""author"":""Nouws, Sem (TU Delft Technology, Policy and Management)"",""contributor"":""Doorn, N.

Travellers have the possibility to use information on current and future traffic situations to make their travel decisions. Travel decisions by individual travellers subsequently influence the performance of a total traffic system. This makes behaviour of travellers an interesting topic to policy makers and road operators. In this thesis travel choice behaviour also plays a central role and we specifically take into account car drivers and en-route route choice. This graduation assignment was done at TNO and after an initial scope further focus was applied resulting in the goal of modelling driver traffic information use and subsequent enroute choice. After coupling en-route route choice to DRIPs as the channel for travel time information in this study it was decided to model in the ITS Modeller. Latter provides a micro simulation environment through which driver behaviour can be analyzed at the individual driver level. First opportunities for improvement in modelled driver use of information during en-route route choice were identified. The following research questions were used to further explore and implement a driver information model. RQ1 How can the DRIP information market be characterized and how do market dynamics affect driver route choice behaviour? Through a concise exploration the DRIP information market and visit to the Verkeerscentrale Midden-Nederland we made some interesting findings. These findings originate from the fact that the DRIP information chain is a complex system involving many technical systems but also a multitude of stakeholders. Some examples resulting from DRIP information dynamics are used to illustrate effects on route choice behaviour. The first example is formed by occasional manual operation of DRIPs by traffic controllers. During this process it appears information provisioning to drivers is prone to delays. Secondly it became clear that the small number of responsible parties for maintenance of DRIP control systems posses a large amount of knowledge seemingly necessary to maintain DRIP information quality. Both examples carry a risk of information quality deteriation and as such a the risk of losing trust of drivers in DRIP information. RQ2 Given the lack of a driver information evaluation mechanism in the ITS Modeller: How can driver route choice behaviour be modelled and implemented? This report identifies an apparent opportunity for improving driver route choice modelling under influence of DRIP travel time information. A driver information model is proposed in which car drivers exhibit updating behaviour on their travel time estimations and uncertainty about these times. The model fits in the current method of modelling route choice in the ITS Modeller. Our driver model is based on uncertainty about a drivers\u2019 own mean travel time estimation and travel times provided by a DRIP. High uncertainty about his own estimation leads a car driver to update his expected travel time closer to that predicted by a DRIP. If the opposite is true then a driver updates his expected travel time closer to his initial estimation. In other words: \u201cUpdated quality perceptions are a weighted average of prior beliefs and observed quality. Weights reflect perceived reliability of prior beliefs and observations, respectively: when the traveller distrusts (trusts) his own observations, updated perceptions of quality are relatively close to initially anticipated quality (observed quality)\u201d (Chorus & Dellaert, Forthcoming) RQ3 What are the route choice effects of the proposed driver informing model? The simulation phase illustrates the difference in driver travel time updating for different levels of uncertainty while all other simulation factors are kept constant. The implemented driver model indeed leads to different updated route cost under influence of travel time information. In the particular scenario comparison overall network effects due to difference in route choice behaviour were minimal though because of the small absolute difference in updated route costs. Further face validity analysis indicates that this small change in route choice behaviour early in the peak period appears to have a positive effect on travel time dispersion. This conclusion is not supported by significance and as such is made with reservation. Based on this study we recommend the following for further research: Practical recommendations: \u0095 Inclusion of truck drivers in use of the driver information model and future research. In this study we assume the group of drivers only consist of car drivers. In practise this is not the case and this study indicated that truck drivers show different route choice behaviour in light of traffic information, specifically route and travel time information through a DRIP. The current study overestimates the effect of provided information. \u0095 The utility function in our study consists of travel time and travel time uncertainty. In practise more factors may be important in a drivers\u2019 en-route route choice consideration. Further research should investigate which factors are important. Practical recommendations: \u0095 During implementation of the model it appeared that an implementation at individual driver level would lead to too high computation times. We consider some opportunities for better implementation to be feasible. TNO has the opportunity to use server based computation. Running the improved driver information model in such an environment might result in acceptable analysis times.An other option is further evolution of the way in which the driver information model is applied to drivers. An implementation could be conducted analogous to current implementation of for example lane changing and car following models. \u0095 We assume the lack of influence of a DRIP on network familiarity. In short route information of a DRIP does not lead to inclusion of a route in a drivers\u2019 route set.

Multiple recent studies state that enhancing the information flows can result in a better functioning organisation.Research descriptionThe information flow between the different layers of an organisation is of high importance. A distinction can be made between formal and informal information flows. Controlling a large organisation, the formal information holds a very dominant and strong position when it comes to information flows. Nevertheless, formal information does not always deliver the managers of the organisation the right information to establish proper coordination and strategy. Conjoining the process of acquiring information informally and the formal information systems of organisations has not been successful so far. The literature indicates that strategies and the way of coordinating an organisation should be based on both the formal and informal information, but chances are that the formal information instruments dominate the informal information. Hollandia Infra believes that there is room for improvement on how to cope with their information flows. The research question formulated in order to help to reflect upon this matter is:\u2018How can information flows be enhanced in construction projects within a construction company?\u2019To answer this question a literature study is conducted to investigate the current theoretical role of information flows in intrafirm supply chains of construction projects. Afterwards a case study has been conducted at the construction company of Hollandia Infra. As part of this case study the intended information flow is studied by conducting a company document study. A Social Network Analysis is carried out in order to understand how the actual information flow functions. The intended and actual information flows are compared. Identified differences are explained by interviewing those involved. To understand the role information flows play in the organisation. The interview findings result in managerial implications which aim to support efforts to enhance the information flows. These managerial implications are validated by interviewing two experts. Theoretical role of information flowsInformation flows can be divided into formal and informal information flows. Formal information flows concern information that is less dependent on individual information holders. This form of information flows is easier to regulate, using IT systems for instance, than informal information flows. The informal information flow is very dependent on the individual information holder and his\/her willingness to share information. The focus of organisations is mainly on the transfer of formal information as organisations aim to provide and produce generic information and guidelines that employees can use to work with. This results in informal information flows playing a background role, while this form of information is of strategical added value. Intended and actual information flowBy carrying out a company document study, the primary process of Hollandia Infra during the construction phase was studied in-depth. Understanding and visualising the workflow and what the function of the different actors in the primary process is, has led to the disclosure of the relationships and the associated information flow. Based on the process schemes of Hollandia Infra it can be assumed who is in contact with whom and thus how the information is intended to flow through the organisation\u2026To this end one would ideally one would ideally apply systems thinking: \u201dSystems thinking is a set of synergistic analytic skills used to improve the capability of identifying and understanding systems, predicting their behaviors, and devising modifications to them in order to produce desired effects. These skills work together as a system.\u201dHowever, because the earlier pluralities it unlikely for a single individual or organisation to have all the required information for this. Processes are required where information is collected and co-created with multiple parties in such as system to enable the creation of comprehensive solutions for these problems. What is required is social learning. Social learning (SL)is learning that happens by people participating in so called communities of practice. A community of practice can be seen as a group of people with converging interests and skills. An example would be a grid operator, which have their own sub-communities (E.G. cable technician or systems manager). They can be smaller groups, E.G. a family, and participation is often not mutually exclusive. Rather than being part of a community of practice one could be seen as being part of the landscape of practice, consisting out of multiple communities. By partaking in these communities people gain experiences by both learning and expanding on a communities\u2019 knowledge.The aim of this thesis is to gain insights into:\u00a01. mechanics shaping and steering social learning\u00a02. how to measure social learning processes for in vivo experimentation\u00a03. design mechanics for participatory modelling processes and Social learning in general to improve development of such processes\u00a0To do this a theory has been made on the mechanics and behaviour of individuals in a SL process. This has been done in chapters 4, 5 and 6. To do this a PM perspective has been used as this give a structure on the actions someone can take and requires shared information to be structured. Additionally it is seen as a useful tool for tackling socio-technical problems.The theory thus focussed on the main action of PM, namely sending information, receiving and processing information and deciding upon the model. To develop the theory knowledge from multiple disciplines is needed. To this end a theory has been developed using supersynthesis. This is a research method where multiple theories are combined to make a new on to explain something. The aim is not to supersed the combined theories, but to explain something new. The fields that have been the focus are communication science, helping understand how information is processed and sent, and social psychology, helping understand why and when individuals take certain actions. The theories have been synthesised in two rounds of conceptualisation, with the first focussing on conceptualising every possible action and mechanic. The ones that were deemed most interesting or useful have been conceptualised more in depth. To this an additional conceptualisation of knowledge and information is made. The final theory is as follows:Knowledge takes the shape of a knowledge graph. In this graph fields of expertise are called topics. One can think about the weather as such a topic. These topics consist out of information items, think cloudiness or temperature, and links between these items indicating their relation, think cloudiness leads to lower temperatures. These items may have links to items from other topics. For example cloudiness is related to sun hours and yields of Photovoltaics from th topic of Photovoltaics.It is assumed that a complete knowledge graph exists. Each individual knows part of this graph, signifying knowledge or expertise in the topic. The larger part of a topic they know the more expertise they have in that topic. This includes both information items as their links (relationships). All these items, links and topics also have a perceived relevance for people. This is based on interests or affiliation. Affiliation means relationship with a group of people, for example, meteorologists. Something is also seen as more relevant if it is discussed often, attributed to common knowledge effects. In a social learning process there are several individuals. Each round they are able to share information. Information is seen as information items and\/or their links. A topic as a whole can also be discussed, but this is not seen as actual information for learning. What they share is based on the amount of energy they have and are willing to spend on sharing information. This is dependent on perceived relevance of the item they are considering to share, their expertise on the related topic and their tiredness. It is assumed that the energy one has decays over rounds.Shared energy is received by others and they start to process it. Here something is integrated or learned if they are able or willing to invest enough energy in the processing. This is dependent on their expertise of the related topic, their perceived relevance of what is shared and their attitude with regards to the sender. If expertise, relevance and attitudes are high enough someone will process and integrate information. Processing energy is also assumed to decay each round.In addition to information on knowledge, individuals can also share relational information. These are details like hobbies and other personal details. These are processed as either positive or negative and influence attitudes.Processing of shared information may also happen during breaks or downtime. Here one has more energy to spend and attitudes are less relevant. Total recall of information is assumed in the whole model (I.E. people do not forget anything).To allow for further reflection on the theory and to act as a proof of concept of the theory the theory has been translated into an agent based simulation model. This model has been analysed in a sensitivity experiment using LHS and extremely randomised forest in addition to a variety of plotting techniques in R.\u00a0Additionally two experiments are designed, inspired by real cases. These are used to reflect on the theory and find less noticeable quirks from the ABM.\u00a0Based on the theory and ABM the following things have been concluded: \u00a0-While communication science theories and social psychology theories have been used for theory development, they are not a be all end all. One can apply other fields if one wants. This specific combination, however works especially well for an individual perspective.-The theory can be used to reflect on SL by practitioners as it tells why and how people can act. Furthermore the idea of the knowledge graph can be\u00a0connected to landscapes of practice, with topics relating to a community and links between items of these topics to those of other relating places where boundaries interact -Matters like conflict and increasing conflict, coalitions, personal inhibitions and norms are some of the values that would make sense to include in the theory. This would make the theory less usable for simulation modelling, however and would add a lot of behaviour that is not directly related to the learning process. To implement these additional behaviour could be conceptualised and added, making the theory more complete but less comprehensive. The most important addition that could be made according to me would be an extension on the actions influencing attitudes and the actual definition of a process result (a participatory built model or a plan). -This new theory is valuable as this individual based perspective has not been taken before, inviting to reflection on practice.-The knowledge graph could be used as a means for building new theories that are comparable. Additionally it is a way to explicitly learning. -The combination between social learning and Participatory modelling has not been made this explicit before. It would allow participatory modellers to reflect on their practice.-The ideas of energy for sharing and processing are quite influential in the ABM. They are interesting as they give clear reasons why learning may not happen or happen suboptimally. For learning to happen information need to be shared. If people lack the energy or the willingness to spend energy sharing will not happen. If they do not have the energy to process this they will also fail to learn. This highlights the need for keeping energy levels in mind when designing these processes. It is assumed that these energy levels decay linearly. While arguably too simplistic still it does show how intensive processes or boring processes can fail.The following design mechanics are proposed:1. Usage of a knowledge graph to keep track of what is learned by researchers\u00a02. Usage of knowledge graph to steer the process order that makes learning more likely (topics that closely relate to all participants first and expand that towards specific participants later down the line).\u00a03. Use set structures, conceptual modelling, drawings and other tools to make information sharing and processing easier and less intensive. This would make the process spend less energy if the used tools are chosen well (I.E. a conceptual drawing of what is said or what someone wants to explain using causal diagramming is probably better to explain ideas than doing so via live programming of a simulation model).\u00a04. Use actions like summarizing what has been said to slow down the process if it becomes to quick, leading to a processing energy deficit.\u00a05. Use means like using an agenda to ensure the speed of the process does not become to slow, leading to boredom and potential energy decays"",""subject topic"":""Social learning; Agent based modelling; Social psychology; Participatory Modelling; communication science; Systems thinking"",""language"":""en"",""publication type"":""master thesis"",""publisher"":null,""isbn"":null,""issn"":null,""patent"":null,""patent status"":null,""bibliographic note"":null,""access restriction"":null,""embargo date"":null,""faculty"":null,""department"":null,""research group"":null,""programme"":""Complex Systems Engineering and Management (CoSEM)"",""project"":null,""coordinates"":null},{""uuid"":""uuid:c18aa681-26e2-42f4-8bb5-6fa7475b7398"",""repository link"":""http:\/\/resolver.tudelft.nl\/uuid:c18aa681-26e2-42f4-8bb5-6fa7475b7398"",""title"":""Geographic information infrastructure and local land use plans: Research at the development of GII and DURP, and their mutual relation within Dutch municipal organizations"",""author"":""De Graaf, P.J."",""contributor"":""Van Loenen, B.

The geographic component of the information gives it extra value, but generating it is very costly. There are many different definitions of GII and it is useful to identify the vital components of which a GII consists. Based on the four GIS dimensions, humanware, orgaware, infoware and technoware different components of a GII can be identified. GII consists of dynamic conditions and possibilities offered to various types of users to generate, share, access, and use geographic information. The infrastructure consists of technical standards, the physical infrastructure, an institutional framework, a financial basis and awareness at the decision making and management levels. GIIs operate at different levels: from corporate to global. The final purpose to develop a GII is to improve decision making. Decisions require information and an optimal GII facilitates the access to current and accurate geographic information. Within governmental organizations the obligated authentic registers will be of increasing importance for the GII. DURP stands for digital exchangeable spatial planning and is setup to modernize the spatial planning process by the Ministry of Housing, Spatial Planning and the Environment. The objectives of the stimulation programme are to make the spatial planning process more effective and efficient through digitalizing of the development, use and exchange of spatial plans, as well as to improve the involvement of citizens and to make the process more transparent. Municipalities are not yet obligated to digitize their local land use plans, but new legislation in the near future is suspected to change this. Digital exchangeable spatial plans consist mainly of geographic information and are used by a lot of users within the municipal organization. Spatial planning on the local level, municipalities, is of great importance. Municipalities are responsible for developing local land use plans, which can be very detailed and have strong judicial value. That is why it is important to have the most up to date local land use plan. The relation between GII and DURP is clearly noticeable here. The characteristics of this relation is the scope of the research. The integration of DURP within a GII will improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the use and development of the spatial plans within the municipal organization. Besides this the existence of a GII could influence the implementation of DURP, as well as DURP could influence the implementation or development of a GII. Between the different municipalities there are strong differences in the implementation of DURP. This all leads to the following research question: How does the implementation and development of geographic information infrastructure within the municipal organization relate to the implementation and development of digital exchangeable spatial plans? Municipal organizations consist of two parts: the political and the official organization. The official organization is usually organized according to the concern model. Specialized decentralized sectors and on top a central concern staff and facilitating services. The sectors are each responsible for specific problem areas, for instance economy or social welfare. Currently most of the municipalities are developing from a company-orientated organization, where the focus is on results and performance to an environmentorientated organization, where the focus is on output and process. \u2018Turn over\u2019 of the organization or decompartmentalization of the sectors is needed to be able to serve the citizens in a better way. Based on the two models of Graafland (1993) and Kok and van Loenen (2005), stages of development of geographic information provision within municipalities are identified. Currently most municipalities are developing from the stages \u2018local control\u2019 to \u2018infrastructure development\u2019 defined by Graafland. Local control is characterized by a development of standards, slight awareness for cooperation and the management level gets involved and tries to formalize internal relations. Infrastructure development is characterized by a start of authentic registers, change of organization and a more top down approach to support development of infrastructure. This transition is a shift from demand driven to supply driven and from controlled bottom-up to controlled top-down. The corresponding stages of the GII development model are from the end of the \u2018stand alone\u2019 stage, to \u2018exchange and standardization on technical level\u2019 and to the beginning of the stage \u2018intermediary\u2019. Finally, when considering information provision within municipal organizations it all turns down to the field of tension between a sector and a corporate approach. The implementation and development of DURP is researched in the selected municipalities. The start of DURP is mainly triggered by external events. Together with the digitizing and making exchangeable of the local land use plans comes standardization. The Information Model Spatial Planning (IMRO) is developed to offer each municipality the same set of standards. Although the IMRO standards leave space open for own interpretation, it is a first step in improving the spatial planning. Many of the investigated municipalities initiated the digitizing together with updating of outdated plans. Municipalities are covered by a large amount of local land use plans, often more than 200. Many plans are joined together, to approximately 30 or 40, and the current situation is recorded. The plans are lay down in object-based geographic information files, in which the regulations and explanations are linked to the planned objects. These projects are mostly supported by the GII coordinating department to help implementing the object-based method of working, together with the ICT department which supports the acquiring and integration of the software. Redesigning of the work processes within the development of a local land use plan and setting up managerial control for the continuation of the standard processes and output are important factors for a successful implementation of DURP. This research did not reveal an observable pattern between the level of development of GII and DURP within the investigated municipalities. The relation must especially be found in human and organizational aspects. Knowledge at the GII coordinating departments has in many cases supported the setup of the digitizing of spatial plans. The object-based method of working, familiar to the GIS community, has caused a culture shock within the departments responsible for spatial planning. Another human aspect is the awareness for sharing geographic information. The possibility of other departments to consult spatial plans through the GII will motivate them to share geographic information as well and to keep the information up-to-date. The vital standardization needed for the digitizing of the spatial plans can be used as an example towards other work processes and information sources. For the generation and dissemination of information through a GII, it is important that all the work processes are optimal designed for the exchange and use of geographic information. Exchange requires standardization. Although there is no relation between the development of the two aspects, GII and DURP are certainly intertwined with each other. The information generated by digital spatial planning is often shared through the GII and a lot of the information required within the spatial planning process is obtained through the GII. In most of the researched municipalities, DURP is integrated within the GII. In other words the GII facilitates an important part of the input and output of information within the spatial planning process."",""subject topic"":null,""language"":""en"",""publication type"":""master thesis"",""publisher"":null,""isbn"":null,""issn"":null,""patent"":null,""patent status"":null,""bibliographic note"":null,""access restriction"":null,""embargo date"":null,""faculty"":""OTB Research Institute for the Built Environment"",""department"":""Geo-information resources"",""research group"":null,""programme"":""GIMA"",""project"":null,""coordinates"":null},{""uuid"":""uuid:e4738fe1-f80f-45ab-be74-83945df9a46e"",""repository link"":""http:\/\/resolver.tudelft.nl\/uuid:e4738fe1-f80f-45ab-be74-83945df9a46e"",""title"":""Woo can tell me what I'm looking for?: An in-depth study on the Information Search Process that is part of Freedom of Information request handling at Ministries of the Dutch National Government"",""author"":""Keulemans, Kees (TU Delft Technology, Policy and Management)"",""contributor"":""Zuiderwijk, AMG (mentor); de Bruijn, J.A.

Facilitating citizens with access to government information is an essential promotor of an open and democratic society. Furthermore, it allows citizens to hold their governments accountable for their actions and make informed political decisions. The proper execution of this right to government information is essential, however, it was found that processing the information requests directed to Ministries of the Dutch Government takes an average of 161 days, where the law states a maximum handling term of 42 days. This delay impedes the citizens\u2019 access to government information and should be addressed. While previous research has been performed towards improving \u201cWoo-request processing,\u201d there is little known about the process itself, nor what the direct causes of delay are. Information management is suggested as a possible culprit. Yet, there is little known about its effects, which are likely to be noticeable in the information search process (ISP) that is part of Woo-request processing. Therefore, the objective of this research is to identify how the existing Woo-request ISP is executed at Ministries of the Dutch National Government and what influences it in order to define improvements for said process in relation to its facilitation of an open and transparent government. This research concludes that the Woo-request ISP is a complex process that is influenced by many factors. Whereas the ISP described by academic literature portrays multiple iterative steps, the Woo-request ISP hardly portrays any iterative steps in relation to an improved definition and understanding of the information problem. As a result, the requestor cannot learn from the search itself and the information found throughout it. Combined with a possible lack of prerequisite knowledge of the requestor, this means that requests are likely to remain broadly defined and vague due to a fear of missing out on information caused by the requestor\u2019s distrust. Therefore, this research suggests that through increased informative interaction between the requestor and the handler, supported by search and content experts, specification of the requests should be facilitated, which is expected to improve the search process. This also builds a relationship of trust between the parties involved, which is expected to increase the chance of a requestor\u2019s cooperation. Furthermore, the Woo-request ISP as it is does not guarantee completeness nor traceability of the search performed. Therefore it is suggested that the information locating phase makes use of a metadata-based centralized search tool that is operated by experienced and trained personnel who are able to access all information applicable to the Woo.Whilst the suggested improvements are likely to have a positive influence on the existing process; there are large hurdles to be overcome. It must be noted that some problems or dependencies might in fact never be overcome. For example, the realization of a centrally accessible archive might never see the day of light, as it conflicts with government tasks and values other than openness and transparency. Additionally, it must be noted that the existing \u201cdocument definition\u201d used by the Dutch government is incredibly broad. This broad definition encases that if the government is to adhere to its laws, almost all currently produced information must be searchable by Woo-request handlers. Especially in a government where a policy rarely stands on its own, it can be challenging to define the end of relevance to a request. Lastly, it must be noted that some requestors might never be pleased with the outcomes of their Woo-request."",""subject topic"":""Freedom of Information; FOI; Information Search Process; Open Government; Transparency; Process modelling; ISP analysis framework"",""language"":""en"",""publication type"":""master thesis"",""publisher"":null,""isbn"":null,""issn"":null,""patent"":null,""patent status"":null,""bibliographic note"":null,""access restriction"":null,""embargo date"":null,""faculty"":null,""department"":null,""research group"":null,""programme"":""Complex Systems Engineering and Management (CoSEM)"",""project"":null,""coordinates"":null},{""uuid"":""uuid:9352369d-e03f-4b2c-acc9-613e4bbdc0ba"",""repository link"":""http:\/\/resolver.tudelft.nl\/uuid:9352369d-e03f-4b2c-acc9-613e4bbdc0ba"",""title"":""Managing semantic metadata in public private information chains: A reference architecture for alignment of semantics, technology and stakeholders"",""author"":""Den Bak, V."",""contributor"":""Janssen, M.F.W.H.A.

Semantic metadata is data that provides context to core data and helps to convey the actual meaning and perspective of the information that is shared among people, systems and organizations. All information sharing activities are aimed at one objective: having the right information available to the end user, with as little loss, time delay and clutter as possible. Using a common set of semantics in electronic information exchange is believed to further reduce costs and time of information exchange, increase information quality and remove many of the unforeseen side effects and complexities of interconnecting stand alone information systems. Semantic metadata management is required in order to use semantic metadata effectively in a PPIC. A common vocabulary is of little use if it does not match organizational requirements. The main difficulty in semantic metadata management is that it touches on many elements of the organizational architecture. Semantic metadata management is primarily an alignment effort and partially a standardization effort. It includes the alignment of processes, technology and data models, both within and beyond organizational boundaries. However, many existing semantic metadata management approaches are ad hoc and lack a coordinated and premeditated approach. There are many theories and studies on individual topics related to metadata management, but a documented approach that puts all elements within the given scope in perspective is non-existent. This master thesis project was aimed at aiding those tasked with implementing a coordinated form of semantic metadata management within the domain of Public Private Information Chains (PPIC). The problem was approached from an enterprise architecture point of view. This means a broad, holistic view was applied. A PPIC is a digital information chain consisting of both public and private parties that is centered around a certain information process with a high rate of repetition and mutual responsibilities. This research project started out with a literature review and expert interviews. Best practices were extracted and tested in an in depth case study with two complementary cases in Dutch government organizations. The main research question has been answered by developing a reference architecture for semantic metadata management in a PPIC. A reference architecture is a generic blueprint that provides a holistic approach for a specific architecture archetype. It puts all elements required for semantic metadata into perspective making it easier to structure the many pieces of the puzzle. The reference architecture uses a format that on the one hand provides enough rigor to ensure interoperability, while on the other hand provides enough leeway to fit organizations with different characteristics or specific requirements. The mixture of rigor and leeway has been achieved by using both prescriptive design principles and tradeoffs that extend the design space. The reference architecture is centered around mitigating the main challenge in this domain and reinforcing one of the main potentials: reduction of complexity. Much of the complexity regarding information exchange in PPIC\u2019s is artificial, not inherently present. Challenges have arisen by creating connections between systems, processes and organizations that were never designed from the outset to be interconnected in such a way. The semantic metadata management approach that is introduced in this research has two pillars. First, a conceptual model is introduced to act as a single point of reference between all components, reducing the number of existing relations. Second, the relations between all components in the organizational architecture are actively managed. This proactive approach reduces incidents and improves information quality. The solution presented in this thesis is generic. The design principles and tradeoffs apply in a similar way to both private and public organizations. Moreover, it applies to organizations with different maturity levels in technology, data management and processes and with a varying level of ambition on this topic. In an information chain the diversity in stakeholders and their interests is a given situation. A certain degree of commitment and effort can be expected from the stakeholders in the chain, but semantic metadata management should not interfere with the private processes or bring an additional burden. The evaluated reference architecture presented in this study deals with this problem. Even though the solution is primarily aimed at providing benefits in inter-organizational information exchange, it is useful for internal use in individual organizations as well."",""subject topic"":""semantic metadata management; public private information chain; reference architecture; information exchange"",""language"":""en"",""publication type"":""master thesis"",""publisher"":null,""isbn"":null,""issn"":null,""patent"":null,""patent status"":null,""bibliographic note"":null,""access restriction"":null,""embargo date"":""2011-11-08"",""faculty"":""Technology, Policy and Management"",""department"":""Infrastructure Systems & Services"",""research group"":null,""programme"":""Information and Communication Technology"",""project"":null,""coordinates"":null},{""uuid"":""uuid:88b6c2fc-b182-4fb2-98c8-25b6a24292ce"",""repository link"":""http:\/\/resolver.tudelft.nl\/uuid:88b6c2fc-b182-4fb2-98c8-25b6a24292ce"",""title"":""A research towards completing the asset information life cycle: An analysis of the relationships between data exchange, BIM and the asset life cycle and the solutions to overcome existing issues at Amsterdam Airport Schiphol."",""author"":""De Vries, L."",""contributor"":""Zlatanova, S.

From their perspective BIM deals with another way of executing design and construction, where collaboration and integration are the key words. In practice BIM has a broader scope and can be defined as, being a process in which relevant actors collaborate on creating, analysing and managing multiple dimension data within a dynamic model representing one or more assets throughout its\/their life cycle. For this thesis research the new data model for asset information at Amsterdam Airport Schiphol, Schiphol GIS or SGIS, was analysed. SGIS replaces four other systems that contained all asset information at Schiphol, but that also contained double and inconsistent information. With SGIS these problems must belong to the past. The data model mostly contains 2D or 2\u00bdD data of all assets, including the most relevant information on the asset. SGIS also communicates, or will do so within two years, with three other systems that as a complex are the back bone of the asset management process at Amsterdam Airport Schiphol. There are currently two problems with completing the asset information life cycle. The first problem is getting the information from the 3D model to SGIS. To solve this problem a workflow is suggested. This workflow includes an export to the open standard IFC from the original 3D AEC modelling software. A small addition to SGIS has to be made therefor, to be able to support the 3D geometries that are coming from that software. The second problem is to get the information back from the operations and maintenance phase to a new design phase. Currently the most optimal solution seems to re-use the received IFC file and to add a DWG containing the changed geometries. Thereby it needs to be mentioned that the multi-patch objects from SGIS will be exploded to individual faces. The preferred solution would have been to work from one central (spatial) database, but that is technically not possible yet. The problems are caused by the fact that AEC (3D modelling) software and GIS do not share a common geometric data model. Additionally it needs to be researched what the actual information demand is for the design phase. In the current situation information gets lost after the exchange from construction to operations and maintenance, because the information need in those phases is less detailed. With the suggested solutions and changes\/additions to SGIS it is possible to complete the asset information life cycle for Schiphol and the relevant stakeholders and main-contractors. An inventory of the necessary resources to plan these changes still needs to be made."",""subject topic"":null,""language"":""en"",""publication type"":""master thesis"",""publisher"":null,""isbn"":null,""issn"":null,""patent"":null,""patent status"":null,""bibliographic note"":null,""access restriction"":null,""embargo date"":null,""faculty"":""OTB Research Institute for the Built Environment"",""department"":""GIS Technology"",""research group"":null,""programme"":null,""project"":null,""coordinates"":null},{""uuid"":""uuid:74aa2390-93c4-4978-bdde-8a63b1635a64"",""repository link"":""http:\/\/resolver.tudelft.nl\/uuid:74aa2390-93c4-4978-bdde-8a63b1635a64"",""title"":""Managing Information Exchange by Improving Information Flows in a Customer-to-Customer Process"",""author"":""Srivastava, Shivam (TU Delft Technology, Policy and Management)"",""contributor"":""Ludema, M.W.

The Damper Division of ZF Friedrichshafen AG (case company), Schweinfurt (SCW) has recently decided to move the production ofits high running parts to its facility in Pune, India. The project is facing typical Supply Chain Management challenges like delay in serial production and delivery schedules, lack of information exchange, ambiguity over roles and responsibilities, and redundant communication between the two facilities SCW and Pune, thus incurring a high transaction cost and low coordination. The literature review about information flows, business processes and process integration provided four principles that help to integrate the information flow between processes. These principles are \u2013 accessibility, transparency, granularity, and timeliness. The analysis pointed that there are information gaps and interrelationship issuesbetween the stakeholders of the project. The issues identified were the need for an information exchange map which can be relied on by all of the stakeholders, timely information exchange, defined responsibilities and roles, and efficient communication. Standardization of information exchange with the help information exchange map together with information sharing rules emerged out as the main conceptual design. This was followed by a participatory design phase where the design was developed together with the stakeholders of the project.Based on the final design with information sharing rules (meeting structure and ground rules), a set of recommendations (including an implementation plan) were laid out to help the managers steer the final design to the best of their use. Currently, the case company is about to implement the design together with the meeting structure and ground rules. It was recommended that the future objective of the company should be to achieve a control tower for central data collection and using the data to generate insights."",""subject topic"":""Information Exchange; Information Flows; Coordination; Supply Chain; Process Integration"",""language"":""en"",""publication type"":""master thesis"",""publisher"":null,""isbn"":null,""issn"":null,""patent"":null,""patent status"":null,""bibliographic note"":null,""access restriction"":null,""embargo date"":""2021-08-31"",""faculty"":null,""department"":null,""research group"":null,""programme"":null,""project"":null,""coordinates"":""50.026610""},{""uuid"":""uuid:7a2b00c0-663b-4334-b2f2-98bc2a39cb32"",""repository link"":""http:\/\/resolver.tudelft.nl\/uuid:7a2b00c0-663b-4334-b2f2-98bc2a39cb32"",""title"":""Marketing intelligence system implementation in B2B service marketing environment: An explorative case study"",""author"":""Kowlesar, Kavish (TU Delft Technology, Policy and Management)"",""contributor"":""Rook, L.

To maintain their position, companies must continually renew their knowledge management systems. The emergence of information technology (IT)-based intelligence systems suggests more possibilities for gathering knowledge than ever before. These possibilities can help to better meet the information needs of marketers in corporate setting. Sparked by implementation of such technologies in the business-to-consumer (B2C) marketing environment, business-to-business (B2B) marketers of the case firm (an IT consulting company) were interested in the possibilities that implementation of state-of-the-art IT based intelligence systems would offer for meeting their information needs. The objective of this research was, therefore, to explore the possibilities of intelligence systems that could add to the marketing information system of B2B marketers. This resulted in the following research question: How should an intelligence system look like to effectively add to the B2B marketing information system of an IT solution consulting company? The literature suggests that differences exist between B2B and B2C marketing. These differences point to different intelligence needs in B2B, which should be met with a different marketing information system. However, literature on the specific intelligence needs of B2B marketers and their marketing information system was not available. Furthermore, the existing literature provides enough knowledge on intelligence systems, but lacked on specific knowledge on IT based marketing intelligence systems, let alone marketing intelligence systems designed specifically for B2B marketing. Based on the available literature on overall intelligence systems, a framework was made that combined several methods and possibilities for intelligence systems. By adding challenges for implementation, this framework could help in determining how an intelligence system for specific purposes would look like. The identified gaps of the literature, combined with the challenges for implementation for intelligence system provide an overview of what information is needed about the B2B marketing environment to answer the research question. METHODOLOGY The information needed for answering the research question was extracted by means of an embedded case study on an IT consulting company. Several units of analysis were distinguished, based on general approaches to B2B marketing. In-depth semi structured interviews with the marketers within the case company were used to gather data. The topics were based on the information gaps in the literature, combined with knowledge from several resources about the marketing environment such as observation, available documentary and introductory interviews. The interviews were transcribed and coded using specialized software (Atlas TI). The analysis focused on finding relationships between key concepts found in the interviews. \u2003 FINDINGS By using this methodology, three phenomena were found. First, by linking the available marketing information system with the marketing needs that were suggested by the marketers, gaps could be identified, which could be used in the development of an intelligence system tailored to the needs of the case company. Converging evidence was found between the identified units of analysis suggesting the existence of an intelligence gap for knowledge on the people working at their customers. Specifically, the B2B marketing information system does provide information on customers, however does so on (too) high (read: general) an abstraction level. The B2B marketers indicated a need for information on a lower (read: more personal and precise) abstraction level, specifically: interest, hobbies, roles, activities, how they are linked together and whether they are part of a decision making unit. Second, the interviews also produced a list of potential data sources for an intelligence system. Scoping these sources towards the needed intelligence suggest that an intelligence system should make use of user-generated content (i.e. social media, blogs and forums), online published interviews and surveys. These sources might contain relevant information, but they are in textual unstructured format. Finally, the preferences for presenting the intelligence were extracted from the marketers. The marketers would prefer intelligence presentation to be implemented in other systems. They would like to have a search option, and they preferred easy to use display of the intelligence. PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS Based on the found phenomena, choices could be made using the framework for intelligence system implementation based of the literature. The proposed intelligence system design was built from the following layers: (1) the intelligence system will use user-generated content (UGC) (i.e. social media, blogs and forums), online published interviews, and surveys as data source. (2), Data will be extracted from these sources using natural language processing methods such as named entity recognition, relationship extraction and sentiment analysis. (3) The extracted data will be stored in databases. (4) OLAP servers will be used for slicing and dicing of the data. (5) The data will be presented as intelligence by use of searchable relational graphs. This form of presentation could be implemented in dashboards of other systems such as the marketers\u2019 CRM system. The intelligence system can add to the marketing information system by providing valuable insight on customers on a lower (read: more personal and precise) abstraction level. This form of intelligence is useful to the marketers, but is not currently provided decently by existing B2B marketing information systems."",""subject topic"":""marketing; intelligence systems; Implementation; B2B; Service marketing; AI; consultan; IT"",""language"":""en"",""publication type"":""master thesis"",""publisher"":null,""isbn"":null,""issn"":null,""patent"":null,""patent status"":null,""bibliographic note"":null,""access restriction"":null,""embargo date"":null,""faculty"":null,""department"":null,""research group"":null,""programme"":""Management of Technology (MoT)"",""project"":null,""coordinates"":null},{""uuid"":""uuid:a0cef429-69c9-40e3-b1a0-9b2764a066f5"",""repository link"":""http:\/\/resolver.tudelft.nl\/uuid:a0cef429-69c9-40e3-b1a0-9b2764a066f5"",""title"":""OV-betalen for international travellers"",""author"":""Lehr, L.Q."",""contributor"":""Kleinsmann, M.S.

The focus is set on international travellers, who arrive at an airport in the Netherlands. Purchasing public transportation tickets in the Netherlands is a hurdle due to OV-betalen, which refers to different varieties of electronic payment in public transportation in the Netherlands. International travellers, who are most frequently first time users of the system, do not know how to acquire an OV-chipkaart (electronic public transportation ticket), what travel products to select and in general make more mistakes throughout their journey, because they do not have established routines like domestic travellers. This is a significant challenge to the Netherlands, as according to a study commissioned by NBTC Holland Marketing, \u201cinbound tourism is a major growth industry within the Dutch economy\u201d. In this study the third main complaint of visitors to the Netherlands is the lack of user-friendliness of public transportation, and it is suggested to improve the smartcard and payment options for travellers (the first is regarding information provision for travellers in general and the second concerns too high process for services). If the Dutch public transportation system provides a better service, not only the travellers benefit from the improved service, but the Netherlands as a country can largely benefit from the travellers. Travellers would have a convenient access to the whole country (as most inbound tourists only travel to Amsterdam) meaning that tourism would spread in the Netherlands. In this project, the TU Delft cooperates with Connexxion, GVB, KLM, NS, RET and Schiphol Group. The study\u2019s approach focuses on the human, societal, technological and business aspect of the product-service system. The project emphasizes the human aspect; therefore the desirability of the product-service-system and the users\u2019 needs and perspectives are prioritised. However, the expertise of the project partners is also fundamental during the process as it provides insight on the feasibility and viability of the proposed solutions. Future Vision: The Dutch public transportation is one system, ran by multiple operators, that cooperate in the backend to provide transparent and unified information to facilitate the usage of the system to its customers in the frontend, in areas, where they do not compete. Service Proposition: Improving infinformation provision and offering a homogenous array of tickets and payment methods it is essential to better the system and the experience of international travellers. To achieve this, the public transportation operators have to share certain touchpoints (such as a website, an app, the interface of ticket vending machines or staff), as well as cooperate to homogenize ticket names and payment options. In order to do so the operators should share a platform to provide information and facilitate ticket purchase. There are basic requirements that must be taken into account when developing the vision and service proposition: \u2022 Accessibility of information: Travellers should be able to access information about public transportation throughout travel phases (before, during and after usage), contexts of use and touchpoints. \u2022 Transparency of information: Travellers should have an overview of the available possibilities within the public transportation system in terms of transportation modalities, time of travel and price to travel. \u2022 Clarity of information: Travellers should be able to understand the information provided to them in the languages available, the terminology used and the design of the different touchpoints. The proposed service is based on a platform for payment in public transport, shared by the public transportation operators. It is embodied by a more digitized system, which also offers alternatives and back-up options to the digital services and a balance between self-service and service personnel. Ultimately, the future vision and service proposition focus on the users\u2019 needs and are technologically feasible. Certain organizational changes must take place in order to make the proposition viable. The following recommendations establish steppingstones towards improving the experience of international travellers when using the Dutch public transportation system: \u2022 Cooperation amongst PTOs: It is imperative that operators work on the service of transportation as a unity, because they currently share a system, but do not always share their services in terms of providing information, assistance or tickets that build up the system. \u2022 Include all stakeholders in the process: Further stakeholders, such as tourism organisations, airports and passenger airlines, can positively contribute when developing solutions to improve the experiences of international travellers. The stakeholders share contexts and in some cases the touchpoints that travellers use and interact with. \u2022 Have a user-centred mind-set: Without travellers and their need of mobility, there would be no necessity of providing public transportation. The impact that the PSS design has on users is critical to provide a better service and also impacts the technological, business and societal aspect of the system. \u2022 Improve the accessibility of information throughout the system: Public transportation is a service designed for everyone in society, hence it is crucial to optimize information accessibility for everyone: different types of travellers, throughout different travel phases, in different contexts of use, that interact with different touchpoints must be able to access information. \u2022 Unify information provision: Unified information will avoid that confusing or misleading information is provided, as well as information overload. The information should be transparent and give enough knowledge to the travellers to make the best choices concerning their trip and their preferences. The PTOs and other stakeholders should facilitate the link for their shared platform to the users. \u2022 Simplify and unify ticketing & payment: Although the Dutch public transportation system shares one payment system (the OV-chipkaart system), the individual PTOs have different product types and ticket names. Simplifying the ticket range, unifying the product range and providing a wide range of the same payment methods throughout the system can make ticket selection and acquisition better for international travellers. Guided by these recommendations, a more user-centred and user-friendly public transportation service can be developed. Improving the public transportation system will benefit the users, the PTOs and other stakeholders, as well as the Netherlands as a whole."",""subject topic"":""OV-chipkaart; usability; service design; public transport; people in transit; user centred design; international travellers"",""language"":""en"",""publication type"":""master thesis"",""publisher"":null,""isbn"":null,""issn"":null,""patent"":null,""patent status"":null,""bibliographic note"":null,""access restriction"":""Campus only"",""embargo date"":null,""faculty"":""Industrial Design Engineering"",""department"":""Industrial Design"",""research group"":null,""programme"":null,""project"":null,""coordinates"":null},{""uuid"":""uuid:b8f5d904-51bb-43c0-88bb-d2d7de79cf4d"",""repository link"":""http:\/\/resolver.tudelft.nl\/uuid:b8f5d904-51bb-43c0-88bb-d2d7de79cf4d"",""title"":""Understanding inter-organizational information sharing: A case-study in the context of Risk and Opportunity Based Asset Management for Critical Infrastructures (ROBAMCI)"",""author"":""Sardjoe, Nishchal (TU Delft Technology, Policy and Management)"",""contributor"":""van de Walle, Bartel (mentor); Hermans, Leon (mentor); Baggen, John (mentor); De Bel, Mark (mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)"",""publication year"":2017,""abstract"":""On a daily basis we (in) directly make use of functions of various infrastructures: we drive on roads and bridges or we live without worries behind the safety of a dike. Only when there are cracks in the dike or a particular bridge is not accessible due to for example a broken pillar, we realize how critical these infrastructures are for our society and economy. These infrastructures are not build to last forever and they are susceptible to breakdowns, especially as some are reaching the end of their technical lifespan. Building new infrastructures is simply not an option, as this is often financially and logistically not feasible. Getting as much as possible out of the remaining technical lifespan of such critical infrastructures is then down to employing innovative maintenance strategies, such as risk and opportunity based asset management, as is being done in the ROBAMCI project, initiated by Deltares. Management and maintenance of infrastructures already takes place in a multi-actor environment. Adding systematic approaches on top of this multi-actor environment requires maintenance managers to further integrate their decision making processes. However, analysis have shown that there is a clear lack of this integrated decision making. Literature has further shown that this could be as a result of a lack of information sharing between organizations. Improving inter-organizational information sharing, however first requires further understandings. This research project is done with the goal to achieve that understanding. A case-study in the context of ROBAMCI was used to study this concpt in a practical environment. The asset in this case was a sea-lock complex located in Delfzijl, which not only performs functions for shipping, but also has various other direct and indirect functions, influencing for example local nature, economy and regional water management. Theoretical knowledge, gained from literature studies, was then used to interpret the data from in-depth interviews with employees of identified organizations. The empirical findings, interpreted through various sources of literature showed that there is a wide array of factors influencing inter-organizational information sharing in the case-study. Among the most mentioned and expected were trust, competing interests\/self-interests and legislations & policies. Organizations also add value to the importance of personal physical interactions and even though the information sharing takes place between actors of one national government, concern for information misuse is also seen as a potential barrier for information sharing. The data has also led to the formation of some factor-relations, we see e.g. that trust forms a positive causal relation with not only information sharing itself, but also has a negative causal relation with concerns of the quality of the information. Data also makes it clear that there is an interrelation between the 3 levels of information sharing. These findings, backed by theory have led to the identification of 2 general fundamentals that can be taken into account when trying to further understand information sharing. The first one focuses on trust and legislations, whereas the second one addresses on the embeddedness of the information sharing levels. Conclusively it can be said that inter-organizational information sharing helps to make more efficient and effective decisions for the management and maintenance of assets. There are many factors that can either positively or negatively influence information sharing. It is recommended that through further studying factor relations their importance can be determined. This can also help to reduce the high number of factors and frameworks. For ROBAMCI it is recommended to use the results of this research as input for a maturity analysis focusing on the inter-organizational information management of organizations in the sector."",""subject topic"":""information sharing; inter-organizational information sharing; knowledge exchange; public sector; Asset Management; risk based asset management; critical infrastructure; management & maintenance; Case Study"",""language"":""en"",""publication type"":""master thesis"",""publisher"":null,""isbn"":null,""issn"":null,""patent"":null,""patent status"":null,""bibliographic note"":null,""access restriction"":null,""embargo date"":null,""faculty"":null,""department"":null,""research group"":null,""programme"":null,""project"":""Risk and Opportunity Based Asset Management for Critical Infrastructures (ROBAMCI)"",""coordinates"":null},{""uuid"":""uuid:84932cd4-1510-4793-9a19-f62b90b9c20e"",""repository link"":""http:\/\/resolver.tudelft.nl\/uuid:84932cd4-1510-4793-9a19-f62b90b9c20e"",""title"":""A new perspective on the challenges of contract management information systems"",""author"":""van Triest, Harmen (TU Delft Civil Engineering and Geosciences)"",""contributor"":""Chan, P.W.C.

It can be directly related to business and project performance (Muhammad et al., 2019). Nevertheless, contracts and contract management have proven to be a complex and risky undertaking. It has been named as one of the main causes of conflict in the construction sector (Jaffar et al., 2011). To mitigate these problems, information systems have been implemented in contract management. Nevertheless, these systems are not fully delivering on their promises. Evidence that overall costs were reduced or an improvement in project performance is very limited (Zhai et al., 2009), and contemporary information systems have often failed to realize their goals (Mutschler et al., 2008). These developments indicate that the implementation process needs optimization. Preliminary research identified two socio-technical theories that are useful for analyzing human-system interactions during the implementation and use of information systems. Activity theory provides the framework for the analysis of human-system interaction. At the same time, boundary objects seem to be involved when multiple specialists transfer knowledge through the use of objects. Information systems are highly involved in this process. Therefore, boundary objects are also included as a focus of this research. These two theories should provide a new perspective on the challenges concerning contract management information systems. This analysis brought a few bad practices to light: \u2022Support for the system users was severely lacking \u2022Wrong tactics were used to incentivize system use \u2022Responsibilities were unclear, and accessibility of necessary knowledge was limited \u2022Solutions were often late and ineffective or only partly effective \u2022Turnkey solutions rarely functioned as desired \u2022Boundary objects are often not handled correctly Generally, the implementation process was characterized as unstructured and reactive. Next, these lessons learned were applied to create a set of recommendations that should improve current practices. The first set of recommendations was aimed at creating the right information system. The creation of a development team is key in facilitating this process. By sharing responsibility over multiple specialists under the guidance of a system coordinator, the information systems can be correctly created. Next, Including feedback from users, keeping the system as simple as possible, and using proper specifications make sure the information system is fit for purpose. The second set of recommendations cover the realization of the requirements for the correct supporting infrastructure for the information system. This consists of the introduction of a few new roles under the support team and some supporting tools to align the supporting structures with the users. This supporting infrastructure requires the introduction of system ambassadors, a system developer, a system coordinator, and a trainer. The necessary supporting mechanisms are two-stage training, system meetings, clear and targeted manuals, and rules, and finally, the securing of common interpretations. Finally, to make the recommendations more usable, they were transformed into the tool-support implementation (TSI) roadmap. This roadmap transforms the recommendations into a two-phase strategy that managers can apply in their projects. The first phase ensures the right conditions to build the correct information system. Consequently, the second ensures the right conditions to create the right supporting structures. Following this roadmap should ensure the proper creation and implementation of a contract management information system. Finally, to bring these conclusions back to the starting point, the following answer to the main research question is provided. Contract management can indeed be improved with an analysis of the implementation process based on socio-technical perspectives. The application of this new perspective brought a new set of problems concerning the implementation of contract management information systems to light. By showing what went wrong, changes could be recommended in order to improve current practices. Therefore, the importance of these challenges lies in the fact they need to be addressed to gain the benefits that information systems are supposed to have. To realize this goal of the research, the recommendations, and tool-support implementation roadmap have been constructed. When these recommendations are applied by using the TSI roadmap, the presumed benefits of information systems should finally be unlocked. As a result of these benefits, current contract management practices are likely to be improved."",""subject topic"":""Contract management; BIM; information systems; activity theory; boundary objects"",""language"":""en"",""publication type"":""master thesis"",""publisher"":null,""isbn"":null,""issn"":null,""patent"":null,""patent status"":null,""bibliographic note"":null,""access restriction"":null,""embargo date"":""2024-02-11"",""faculty"":null,""department"":null,""research group"":null,""programme"":""Civil Engineering | Construction Management and Engineering"",""project"":null,""coordinates"":null},{""uuid"":""uuid:f8f34325-e428-4605-91c9-64c7387f41b5"",""repository link"":""http:\/\/resolver.tudelft.nl\/uuid:f8f34325-e428-4605-91c9-64c7387f41b5"",""title"":""Digital Solutions for a Circular Facade Economy: A conceptual framework for a Facade's Product Passport to Facilitate decision making at its End of Service(EoS)"",""author"":""Holla, Abhishek (TU Delft Architecture and the Built Environment)"",""contributor"":""Turrin, M.

Two of the most prominent ones are Cirlinq, an asset management platform for documenting building facades, and FaSA (Fa\u00e7ade Service Applicate), a collective of stakeholders aiming to use drones and image recognition technology predict the maintenance requirement of facades. There are also attempts to extend the producers' responsibility by developing new business models in collaboration with TU Delft, resulting in developing a Fa\u00e7ade Leasing Business model. However, despite these several initiatives and the emergence of new technology to facilitate them, there was still a lack of clarity on how they can be integrated to collect, organize and use fa\u00e7ade information to enable decision-making at its End of service. The first steps of the research involved conducting a literature review on the current state of the art in Circularity, the fa\u00e7ade industry, and digital technology in the lifecycle of a fa\u00e7ade. A preliminary framework was generated that conceptually maps out the information generated in the lifecycle of a fa\u00e7ade, a data structure to store this information, and a conceptual framework for a fa\u00e7ade product passport. Based on this preliminary framework, several hypotheses were tested and validated or refuted using surveys and interviews, which helped develop a more detailed framework. This contains detailed process maps of stakeholder roles in the supply chain of the fa\u00e7ade, the digital methods used, and information exchanged in the process.Several criteria are identified by referring to additional literature that can influence the End of Service (EoS) scenario of a fa\u00e7ade and are categorized and arranged into decision trees, which eventually can form a framework for a computational tool. These are then grouped into modules which, when processed together, results in a decision. The criteria were then co-related to the information currently exchanged by the stakeholders to determine what is most crucial to making a decision. During this process, it was found that most information required to make a decision is un-processable by computational methods; firstly, they are in unstructured data formats such as documents, and secondly, the necessary criteria to make a decision are subjective and still need human interpretation. Therefore, the decision-making framework can either be used to evaluate existing facades scheduled for demolition or determine the crucial information to be entered in the passport for facades that are not yet constructed. The entire framework from information capture, organization, and end-of-life decision-making is then demonstrated with information received of the CiTG Fa\u00e7ade in the TU Delft campus as part of the Fa\u00e7ade Leasing project TU Delft. During this evaluation, it was found that several essential information about the fa\u00e7ade not available, and hence the fa\u00e7ade was evaluated by assuming industry-standard processes and references to external databases such as the Granta Edu Pack. Information that is available and information generated is noted, which indicates the most crucial information required for EoS Decision making. During the EoS assessment process, while the fa\u00e7ade can be disassembled and reused, it can be done early to design a new building, as it had fixed non-modular dimensions. Many conditions have to be considered, mainly regarding sizing, geometry, positioning, and structural system of the fa\u00e7ade while designing the building for the CiTG fa\u00e7ade to be reused. It was also found that recycling and energy recovery of the fa\u00e7ade is only possible if the separation between the aluminum profiles and the thermal barrier is achieved. Although specific modules such as the condition assessment and the performance assessment could not be thoroughly carried out, a table with results of the assessments is generated and therefore acts as a starting point of how this framework can eventually be used and adapted to assess different facades. This framework can be eventually be developed in an iterative manner which can expand it to cater to multiple fa\u00e7ade typologies and eventually forming a basis for an EoS assessment tool. All the research questions are answered at the end, acting as a summary of findings. As this research is just a starting point for further in-depth research, conclusions are made regarding recommendations to the Dutch Metal Fa\u00e7ade industry and the following possible research stages. Research descriptionThe information flow between the different layers of an organisation is of high importance. A distinction can be made between formal and informal information flows. Controlling a large organisation, the formal information holds a very dominant and strong position when it comes to information flows. Nevertheless, formal information does not always deliver the managers of the organisation the right information to establish proper coordination and strategy. Conjoining the process of acquiring information informally and the formal information systems of organisations has not been successful so far. The literature indicates that strategies and the way of coordinating an organisation should be based on both the formal and informal information, but chances are that the formal information instruments dominate the informal information. Hollandia Infra believes that there is room for improvement on how to cope with their information flows. The research question formulated in order to help to reflect upon this matter is:\u2018How can information flows be enhanced in construction projects within a construction company?\u2019To answer this question a literature study is conducted to investigate the current theoretical role of information flows in intrafirm supply chains of construction projects. Afterwards a case study has been conducted at the construction company of Hollandia Infra. As part of this case study the intended information flow is studied by conducting a company document study. A Social Network Analysis is carried out in order to understand how the actual information flow functions. The intended and actual information flows are compared. Identified differences are explained by interviewing those involved. To understand the role information flows play in the organisation. The interview findings result in managerial implications which aim to support efforts to enhance the information flows. These managerial implications are validated by interviewing two experts. Theoretical role of information flowsInformation flows can be divided into formal and informal information flows. Formal information flows concern information that is less dependent on individual information holders. This form of information flows is easier to regulate, using IT systems for instance, than informal information flows. The informal information flow is very dependent on the individual information holder and his\/her willingness to share information. The focus of organisations is mainly on the transfer of formal information as organisations aim to provide and produce generic information and guidelines that employees can use to work with. This results in informal information flows playing a background role, while this form of information is of strategical added value. Intended and actual information flowBy carrying out a company document study, the primary process of Hollandia Infra during the construction phase was studied in-depth. Understanding and visualising the workflow and what the function of the different actors in the primary process is, has led to the disclosure of the relationships and the associated information flow. Based on the process schemes of Hollandia Infra it can be assumed who is in contact with whom and thus how the information is intended to flow through the organisation\u2026The Damper Division of ZF Friedrichshafen AG (case company), Schweinfurt (SCW) has recently decided to move the production ofits high running parts to its facility in Pune, India. The project is facing typical Supply Chain Management challenges like delay in serial production and delivery schedules, lack of information exchange, ambiguity over roles and responsibilities, and redundant communication between the two facilities SCW and Pune, thus incurring a high transaction cost and low coordination. The literature review about information flows, business processes and process integration provided four principles that help to integrate the information flow between processes. These principles are \u2013 accessibility, transparency, granularity, and timeliness. The analysis pointed that there are information gaps and interrelationship issuesbetween the stakeholders of the project. The issues identified were the need for an information exchange map which can be relied on by all of the stakeholders, timely information exchange, defined responsibilities and roles, and efficient communication. Standardization of information exchange with the help information exchange map together with information sharing rules emerged out as the main conceptual design. This was followed by a participatory design phase where the design was developed together with the stakeholders of the project.Based on the final design with information sharing rules (meeting structure and ground rules), a set of recommendations (including an implementation plan) were laid out to help the managers steer the final design to the best of their use. Currently, the case company is about to implement the design together with the meeting structure and ground rules. It was recommended that the future objective of the company should be to achieve a control tower for central data collection and using the data to generate insights."",""subject topic"":""Information Exchange; Information Flows; Coordination; Supply Chain; Process Integration"",""language"":""en"",""publication type"":""master thesis"",""publisher"":null,""isbn"":null,""issn"":null,""patent"":null,""patent status"":null,""bibliographic note"":null,""access restriction"":null,""embargo date"":""2021-08-31"",""faculty"":null,""department"":null,""research group"":null,""programme"":null,""project"":null,""coordinates"":""50.026610""},{""uuid"":""uuid:78a12359-a9a9-4b65-8e8f-83aeae8b8939"",""repository link"":""http:\/\/resolver.tudelft.nl\/uuid:78a12359-a9a9-4b65-8e8f-83aeae8b8939"",""title"":""The relation between the organizational information security climate and employees\u2019 information security behavior"",""author"":""Timmermans, Jan (TU Delft Technology, Policy and Management)"",""contributor"":""van Eeten, Michel (mentor); Pieters, Wolter (mentor); Kroesen, Maarten (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)"",""publication year"":2018,""abstract"":""Employees are often referred to as the main cause of cyber security incidents in organizations.

Therefore, the objective of this graduation research is to determine the workflows for information management to allow digitization across the whole lifecycle, by examining multiple aspects. The case study findings lead to the creation of a process map, demonstrating more efficient workflows to be followed, by linking the distributed information between the different parties involved throughout the several project stages, while also considering each party\u2019s digital ambitions. The main processes identified during each project stage concern the production of information deliverables by the respective party, using the suitable format. As both geometrical and non-geometrical information is generated during the different project stages, different formats are used, i.e. information models and documentation. Subsequently and at the end of each stage, the respective information is shared to other parties during specific information exchange moments. A collaborative environment is used by the different parties, both during the production and information sharing. Concluding, as digital transformation becomes even more widespread, a growing number of organizations strive for effective information management. To acquire a more reliable view on the subject, it is necessary to look at several aspects at once, hence the development of the proposed process map.

Most of the public infrastructure assets\u2019 condition nowadays deteriorate due to ageing and municipalities confront challenges to manage their portfolios effectively by adopting proactive management strategies. To succeed the highest possible value from assets, asset management is being adopted as an industry practice in the Dutch construction sector. Successfully managing assets requires managers at the handover stage to acquire accurate, explicit, and complete information from the earlier stages (Design and Construction phase). Only with reliable information they can make the right decisions about costs, performance, and risks which are the pillars of asset management theory. However, the information in the operations stage is incomplete or invalid and dispersed in various sources. This is an obstacle to reuse knowledge as asset managers have to identify information from various sources leading to secondary costs. Significant barriers are the asset managers' limited involvement from the project's beginning. That makes their needs less explicit for contractors and reduces the level of understanding of what information they have to deliver. This thesis works towards providing a more reusable and flexible method in the construction industry for capturing and structuring the strategic information needs of asset managers in a machine and human-understandable way. Linked data and semantic web technologies were used to capture and structure the information and create an ontology. In conclusion, the research demonstrated a way of identifying, capturing and structuring asset information needs with which users can communicate effectively using a common language. The ontology aggregates and stores information from diverse sources and enhance the communication between parties by providing them a common understanding given the specific scope. In this way, the information needs of asset managers can be explicitly defined from the beginning of a project, resulting to complete and reusable information. Now the understanding of what information has to be transferred to asset managers is more straightforward, reusable and unambiguous, resulting in reduced time retrieval of information and secondary costs (e.g. looking for information)."",""subject topic"":""Asset management; Public Sewerage Systems; Information Technology; Knowledge Management"",""language"":""en"",""publication type"":""master thesis"",""publisher"":null,""isbn"":null,""issn"":null,""patent"":null,""patent status"":null,""bibliographic note"":null,""access restriction"":null,""embargo date"":null,""faculty"":null,""department"":null,""research group"":null,""programme"":""Civil Engineering | Construction Management and Engineering"",""project"":null,""coordinates"":null},{""uuid"":""uuid:bb2314c8-9bf8-4141-bc3d-050a784b65ca"",""repository link"":""http:\/\/resolver.tudelft.nl\/uuid:bb2314c8-9bf8-4141-bc3d-050a784b65ca"",""title"":""Finding a balance between meaningful and useful participation by improving information provision: Assessing the effectiveness of information provision approaches in participatory value evaluation on empowering participants to give informed input on urban climate adaptation projects"",""author"":""Nouws, Sem (TU Delft Technology, Policy and Management)"",""contributor"":""Doorn, N.

Travellers have the possibility to use information on current and future traffic situations to make their travel decisions. Travel decisions by individual travellers subsequently influence the performance of a total traffic system. This makes behaviour of travellers an interesting topic to policy makers and road operators. In this thesis travel choice behaviour also plays a central role and we specifically take into account car drivers and en-route route choice. This graduation assignment was done at TNO and after an initial scope further focus was applied resulting in the goal of modelling driver traffic information use and subsequent enroute choice. After coupling en-route route choice to DRIPs as the channel for travel time information in this study it was decided to model in the ITS Modeller. Latter provides a micro simulation environment through which driver behaviour can be analyzed at the individual driver level. First opportunities for improvement in modelled driver use of information during en-route route choice were identified. The following research questions were used to further explore and implement a driver information model. RQ1 How can the DRIP information market be characterized and how do market dynamics affect driver route choice behaviour? Through a concise exploration the DRIP information market and visit to the Verkeerscentrale Midden-Nederland we made some interesting findings. These findings originate from the fact that the DRIP information chain is a complex system involving many technical systems but also a multitude of stakeholders. Some examples resulting from DRIP information dynamics are used to illustrate effects on route choice behaviour. The first example is formed by occasional manual operation of DRIPs by traffic controllers. During this process it appears information provisioning to drivers is prone to delays. Secondly it became clear that the small number of responsible parties for maintenance of DRIP control systems posses a large amount of knowledge seemingly necessary to maintain DRIP information quality. Both examples carry a risk of information quality deteriation and as such a the risk of losing trust of drivers in DRIP information. RQ2 Given the lack of a driver information evaluation mechanism in the ITS Modeller: How can driver route choice behaviour be modelled and implemented? This report identifies an apparent opportunity for improving driver route choice modelling under influence of DRIP travel time information. A driver information model is proposed in which car drivers exhibit updating behaviour on their travel time estimations and uncertainty about these times. The model fits in the current method of modelling route choice in the ITS Modeller. Our driver model is based on uncertainty about a drivers\u2019 own mean travel time estimation and travel times provided by a DRIP. High uncertainty about his own estimation leads a car driver to update his expected travel time closer to that predicted by a DRIP. If the opposite is true then a driver updates his expected travel time closer to his initial estimation. In other words: \u201cUpdated quality perceptions are a weighted average of prior beliefs and observed quality. Weights reflect perceived reliability of prior beliefs and observations, respectively: when the traveller distrusts (trusts) his own observations, updated perceptions of quality are relatively close to initially anticipated quality (observed quality)\u201d (Chorus & Dellaert, Forthcoming) RQ3 What are the route choice effects of the proposed driver informing model? The simulation phase illustrates the difference in driver travel time updating for different levels of uncertainty while all other simulation factors are kept constant. The implemented driver model indeed leads to different updated route cost under influence of travel time information. In the particular scenario comparison overall network effects due to difference in route choice behaviour were minimal though because of the small absolute difference in updated route costs. Further face validity analysis indicates that this small change in route choice behaviour early in the peak period appears to have a positive effect on travel time dispersion. This conclusion is not supported by significance and as such is made with reservation. Based on this study we recommend the following for further research: Practical recommendations: \u0095 Inclusion of truck drivers in use of the driver information model and future research. In this study we assume the group of drivers only consist of car drivers. In practise this is not the case and this study indicated that truck drivers show different route choice behaviour in light of traffic information, specifically route and travel time information through a DRIP. The current study overestimates the effect of provided information. \u0095 The utility function in our study consists of travel time and travel time uncertainty. In practise more factors may be important in a drivers\u2019 en-route route choice consideration. Further research should investigate which factors are important. Practical recommendations: \u0095 During implementation of the model it appeared that an implementation at individual driver level would lead to too high computation times. We consider some opportunities for better implementation to be feasible. TNO has the opportunity to use server based computation. Running the improved driver information model in such an environment might result in acceptable analysis times.An other option is further evolution of the way in which the driver information model is applied to drivers. An implementation could be conducted analogous to current implementation of for example lane changing and car following models. \u0095 We assume the lack of influence of a DRIP on network familiarity. In short route information of a DRIP does not lead to inclusion of a route in a drivers\u2019 route set. Further improvement of the driver information model ought to take inclusion into account. \u0095 We saw that in certain situations DRIP information delays occur outside of control of the CDMS (Centraal DRIP Management Systeem). It is deemed beneficial if the source of this delay, manual operation, is taken into consideration and how this affects DRIP information delay. Gained insights could be used to have a future calibrated driver information model more robust."",""subject topic"":null,""language"":""en"",""publication type"":""master thesis"",""publisher"":null,""isbn"":null,""issn"":null,""patent"":null,""patent status"":null,""bibliographic note"":null,""access restriction"":null,""embargo date"":null,""faculty"":""Civil Engineering and Geosciences"",""department"":""Transport & Planning"",""research group"":null,""programme"":null,""project"":null,""coordinates"":null},{""uuid"":""uuid:5147962b-36c7-4e41-8b6f-3df7a2f83038"",""repository link"":""http:\/\/resolver.tudelft.nl\/uuid:5147962b-36c7-4e41-8b6f-3df7a2f83038"",""title"":""Refugees' movement in immobility: A study investigating information seeking movements by refugees fleeing to Europe"",""author"":""Blok, Jeanne (TU Delft Architecture and the Built Environment)"",""contributor"":""Balz, Verena (mentor); van der Hoeven, Franklin (mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)"",""publication year"":2018,""abstract"":""For refugees that are fleeing is access to reliable information of great importance in order to allow them to seek for what they need and avoid dangers.

In the Mekong Delta several shrimp farms are established, due to its stable weather and environmental conditions making it possible to farm throughout the whole year. The farm where this research was done is an extensive culture system. In these systems, the water is exchanged using the tidal range. During low water, water is let out and with the incoming tide water is let in. No feeding or other improvements to increase the shrimp harvest are done. These systems are often combined with another agricultural production system like for instance rice or mangroves. The extensive culture system used for this research is a so-called mangrove-shrimp system. Channels are used to farm shrimp and the land between the channels is used to grow mangroves. A good harvest is important for the farmers to earn money, manage the pond, and stay independent. It is said that during the last decade the harvest of shrimp has decreased. A large number of factors can cause this decrease of the harvest. A computer model is made describing the water movement in combination with the water quality to understand the system and to find alternatives to improve the dissolved oxygen concentration. Measurements were done in Vietnam concerning the water movement and water quality. Their analysis showed that the sediment consumed a lot of dissolved oxygen. The model showed that the dissolved oxygen concentration in the forest was lower compared to the channels. During inlet water from the forest, containing very low dissolved oxygen concentrations flowed into channels and decreased the dissolved oxygen concentrations in it. During inlet the dissolved oxygen concentrations increased rapidly. The sections situated further from the sluices were not good influenced, by the time the water reached these parts the dissolved oxygen concentration already decreased due to the high consumption of dissolved oxygen by the sediment. Several different options were looked at to improve the dissolved oxygen concentrations. These options concerned increasing the influence oxygen providers, and decreasing the influence of the oxygen consumers. The most important conclusions found after this research were that - If the water level inside the pond follow the tide, the water level changed constantly causing a permanent flow in the system. Together with exchanging more water, more leaf litter will be transported out of the pond. Less leaf litter present decreases dissolved oxygen consumption resulting in higher dissolved oxygen concentrations. - If the pond is managed using sluices, the combination of mangroves and shrimp decreases the amount of water daily exchanged and so decreases the self-cleaning of the system. The combination of the mangroves and shrimp in a system managed with sluices is not a good one. - More research must be done concerning the functioning of the pond (nursery or shrimp trap), population dynamics and other factors for the decreasing harvest that like predators and diseases."",""subject topic"":""water quality; mangrove"",""language"":""en"",""publication type"":""master thesis"",""publisher"":""TU Delft, Civil Engineering and Geosciences, Hydraulic Engineering"",""isbn"":null,""issn"":null,""patent"":null,""patent status"":null,""bibliographic note"":null,""access restriction"":null,""embargo date"":null,""faculty"":""Civil Engineering and Geosciences"",""department"":null,""research group"":null,""programme"":null,""project"":null,""coordinates"":null},{""uuid"":""uuid:34b1d243-f51f-4227-9800-7b7d8815df60"",""repository link"":""http:\/\/resolver.tudelft.nl\/uuid:34b1d243-f51f-4227-9800-7b7d8815df60"",""title"":""Transport van granulair bodemmateriaal: Een onderzoek naar transport bij lage hydraulische belasting"",""author"":""Forschelen, P."",""contributor"":""Fontijn, H.L.

De experimenten zijn uitgevoerd onder gelijke condities als bij de onderzoeken van Paintal (1969) en De Boer (1998). Bij de onderzoeken is dezelfde bodemopbouw, hetzelfde bodemmateriaal en dezelfde aanleg van het testbed gebruikt. De meettechnieken waren bij de onderzoeken verschillend, maar hadden als uitgangspunt dezelfde definitie van transport: het volume bodemmateriaal dat door een raai verplaatst per eenheid van breedte en per tijdseenheid. De experimenten die in dit onderzoek zijn uitgevoerd leveren informatie op over de oorzaken van de verschillen tussen de resultaten van onderzoeken van Paintal (1969) en De Boer (1998). De resultaten van de experimenten van dit onderzoek leiden tot de volgende coclusies over de invloedsfactoren: - De vorm van het bodemmateriaal heeft geen invloed op het transport bij de hydraulische belastingen en het bodemmateriaal die in dit onderzoek zijn toegepast. - Gedurende een meting verandert de hoeveelheid transport in de tijd, er treedt een rijpingsproces op. Het bed stelt zich in op de belasting waardoor geleidelijk het transport daalt tot een constante waarde. Bij de experimenten van dit onderzoek was in 90% van de gevallen het transport tijdens het rijpingsproces \u00e9\u00e9n tot zes keer hoger dan na het rijpingsproces. De resultaten van de verschillende onderzoeken zijn vervolgens vergeleken. Dit heeft geleid tot de volgende conclusies: - De mobiliteitsparameter is in het onderzoek van Paintal (1969) en het onderzoek van De Boer (1998) verschillend gedefinieerd. De hydraulische belasting op het bodemmateriaal is in de mobiliteitsparameter verwerkt met de bodemschuifspanning ( b). De schuifspanning die door de stroming op de bodem wordt uitgeoefend is afhankelijk van de ruwheid van de bodem. Deze ruwheid kan vervolgens worden gesplitst in de ruwheid van het bodemmateriaal en de ruwheid van de vorm van het bed. Bij het onderzoek van Paintal is alleen de schuifspanning in de mobiliteitsparameter verwerkt die afhankelijk is van de ruwheid van het bodemmateriaal. Bij het onderzoek van De Boer is de schuifspanning in de mobiliteitsparameter verwerkt van de bodem. Het verschil in transport kan worden verminderd door dezelfde schuifspanning te verwerken in de mobiliteitsparameter. - De transportparameter is in het onderzoek van Paintal (1969) en het onderzoek van De Boer (1998) gelijk gedefinieerd: het volume bodemmateriaal dat door een raai verplaatst per eenheid van breedte en eenheid van tijd. Bij het onderzoek van De Boer wordt echter het transport onderschat door het transport te meten over bijna de gehele breedte van de goot. De experimenten zijn bij het onderzoek van De Boer uitgevoerd in een smalle kantelgoot (B\/h=2). De invloed van de wanden op de stroming is niet te verwaarlozen; de snelheid van de stroming is bij de wanden lager dan in de as van de goot. Het transport van bodemmateriaal is sterk afhankelijk van de snelheid van de stroming. De mobiliteitsparameter wordt in het onderzoek gerelateerd aan het snelheidsprofiel in de as van de goot; hierdoor wordt minder transport gemeten dan representatief is bij de mobiliteitsparameter. Dit leidt tot de volgende hoofdconclusie: De verschillen tussen de resultaten van de onderzoeken van Paintal (1969) en De Boer (1998) zijn te verklaren met de verschillen in meettechnieken en definities. De resultaten van het onderzoek van De Boer onderschatten het transport en kunnen hierdoor niet worden gebruikt om het transport van bodemmateriaal te voorspellen. Met de resultaten van de onderzoeken van Paintal en Forschelen (1999) kan het transport van bodemmateriaal wel worden voorspeld. De resultaten van de onderzoeken van Paintal en van Forschelen verschillen afhankelijk van de gebruikte definitie van de mobiliteitsparameter. Bij een mobiliteitsparameter gerelateerd aan de bodemschuifspanning komen de resultaten van de onderzoeken van Paintal en van Forschelen overeen. Bij een mobiliteitsparameter gerelateerd aan de korrelschuifspanning (schuifspanning gerelateerd aan de ruwheid van de korrels) komen de resultaten niet overeen; het transport van volume bodemmateriaal is factor twee tot vijf lager bij metingen van het onderzoek van Paintal ten opzichte van de metingen van het onderzoek van Forschelen."",""subject topic"":""bed load; bed stability; paintal; shields"",""language"":""nl"",""publication type"":""master thesis"",""publisher"":null,""isbn"":null,""issn"":null,""patent"":null,""patent status"":null,""bibliographic note"":null,""access restriction"":null,""embargo date"":null,""faculty"":""Civil Engineering and Geosciences"",""department"":""Hydraulic Engineering"",""research group"":null,""programme"":null,""project"":null,""coordinates"":null},{""uuid"":""uuid:5311a43b-051c-4b5f-9f61-aed33d6bea39"",""repository link"":""http:\/\/resolver.tudelft.nl\/uuid:5311a43b-051c-4b5f-9f61-aed33d6bea39"",""title"":""White water modeling - Feasibility of numerical simulation methods in design of white water canoe courses"",""author"":""Hollanders, A.P.G."",""contributor"":""Stelling, G.S.

This brown sugar comes from Indonesia and is a tasty, healthy and sustainable alternative to regular sugar. It is wild-harvested from the Arenga palm tree, which grows naturally inside the jungle. The Arenga sugar provides the local farmers with an income from their existing forests and motivates them to halt deforestation and protect biodiversity. This background story should be communicated to end-consumers. The first analysis phase consists of research about the sugar\u2019s source, the context of use, and the sugar\u2019s characteristics. Applying the Material Driven Design method stimulates to not take the granulated, brown Arenga sugar as given, but play with texture, shape and process to find a more suitable way to serve it. Synthesizing the insights into a Material Experience Vision and Design Criteria leads to a variety of ideas, categorised into 9 design directions. From those, 3 concepts are worked out. The stencil shaker concept makes use of the dark colour of the sugar and puts a surprise illustration, depicting the rainforest\u2019s biodiversity, on the milk foam of the caf\u00e9 guest\u2019s drink. The rainforest globe concept is a decorative, round sugar pot from glass, depicting the eco-system of the Arenga tree and the rainforest. The selected concept of the sugar block grater lets the user transform traditional, hard sugar blocks into flakes. A more specific vision is defined to develop this concept. The metaphor of a opening flower bud describes the desired user experience. The sugar should be perceived as natural and special. It is furthermore desired to let the caf\u00e9 guests explore the background story of the sugar and get actively involved in it, feeling curiosity, pleasant surprise and virtuousness. The final design proposal is a grater made out of bamboo, which is placed on the caf\u00e9\u2019s tables. It is filled with cylindrical sugar blocks with chocolate-like texture. The caf\u00e9 guest can grate sugar flakes by rotating the base of the grater. A mechanism turns and pushes the sugar blocks against a knife with two blades, shaving off a layered spiral of flakes. The sugar comes out at the top of the grater in the shape of a flower. The user can observe the sugar \u201cgrowing\u201d inside an illustration of the rainforest, which is engraved in the bamboo around. This lets the user experience how the sugar naturally grows inside the biodiverse rainforest in Indonesia, contrary to being cultivated in monoculture plantations. The background story of the sugar is illustrated with engravings on the outside of the greater, showing how the sugar is wild-harvested and processed. The caf\u00e9 guests become part of the process by grating their own sugar flakes to sweeten their drinks. This drives a sustainable system of rainforest and local farmers. The sugar is presented as special and natural, in an attractive and novel way. The concept is tested with a working prototype and evaluated by users and caf\u00e9s."",""subject topic"":""Integrated Product Design; Sustainability; Experience; Sugar; Material Driven Design; Food Design"",""language"":""en"",""publication type"":""master thesis"",""publisher"":null,""isbn"":null,""issn"":null,""patent"":null,""patent status"":null,""bibliographic note"":null,""access restriction"":null,""embargo date"":null,""faculty"":null,""department"":null,""research group"":null,""programme"":""Integrated Product Design"",""project"":null,""coordinates"":null},{""uuid"":""uuid:7a0b8590-2b97-4481-8b0d-0b832189ad88"",""repository link"":""http:\/\/resolver.tudelft.nl\/uuid:7a0b8590-2b97-4481-8b0d-0b832189ad88"",""title"":""Wall-Modelled Large Eddy Simulation of fully rough non-uniform flow for the purpose of predicting stone stability"",""author"":""NIKOLAIDOU, Lina (TU Delft Civil Engineering and Geosciences)"",""contributor"":""Uijttewaal, W.S.J.

According to the International Energy Agency (IEA), in 2018, the building sector alone constituted 28 % of all energy-related CO2 emissions. In an effort to reduce the carbon footprint of the building sector, the European Union has decreed that every new building from 2021 must be a nearly zero energy building where the low energy for such buildings must come from renewable sources. While this policy works well for new buildings, there needs to be also a solution developed for existing buildings or monumental buildings to be able to easily harness renewable energy, without the need for any major and costly renovation. The concept of a flexible cloth-based solar curtain as a plug and play solution for existing buildings has been explored in the current research, with particular focus on a bifacial (two-sided) design, to assess the significance of the indoor reflected daylight and artificial lights on the rear side power output of such a semi-transparent solar curtain. An optical model representing a basic semi-transparent curtain comprising 70 % cloth of roughly 62 % transparency (based on availability), and 30 % of bifacial solar photovoltaic (PV) minimodules, is prepared as a base case. To validate the optical model, it is replicated on a smaller scale and tested using an identical experimental setup in a controlled environment using a solar simulator. Four cases are prepared for this: the curtain in an empty white-walled room, the curtain in the same room but with some furniture, the curtain in a shorter room with a white rear wall and the curtain in a shorter room with a black rear wall. An analysis of simulation and experimental results shows near likeness between the two with an error margin of 3.3 % for the base case to 10.6 % for the black rear wall case. Slight non uniformity of optical property inputs used in the simulation model and an overestimation of experimentally measured power due to a relatively lower irradiance seen by the reference cell are attributed to this difference. After successful validation of the optical layout, the model is made to scale in simulations to forma PV curtain module of 538.44 Wp DC installed capacity. Using a north-east facing room as reference, an annual simulation is found to give a total DC energy yield of 188.45 kWh or 323 kWh\/kWp with a bifacial gain of 8.64 %. 10 hours daily of artificial lighting inside the office is seen to increase the annual DC energy yield by 1.33 %. With an assumption that the curtain remains closed throughout sunshine hours (since it allows diffuse light to enter through its porous cloth), the power output of the curtain is seen to meet modest DC annual load profiles of 57.76 kWh in an office room for 95 % of the year with a 145 Wh lithium ion battery bank and of 48.86 kWh in a residential room for 92%of the year, but with a much higher 290 Wh battery capacity, due to a greater mismatch between generation and demand. A sensitivity analysis for room orientation shows that for a more optimal azimuth of 202.5\u00b0 (180\u00b0 being south), the same curtain gives 82%more annual DC yield compared to its current orientation, but at a much lower bifacial gain of 7.8 %. When analyzed for performance in different locations across the world, the curtain intuitively gives the best yield for locations in the southern hemisphere due to its orientation towards the north east. Bifacial gain is nevertheless, most significant for temperate locations where low average annual insolation makes the gain due to bifacial more significant. In cases where the room depth is reduced by half, yield is seen to improve by 2.1 %. Halving the amount of PV in the curtain, improves the bifacial gain by nearly 0.6 % but reduces the annual yield by 49 %. Conversely, doubling the PV in the curtain, results in a dip in bifacial gain by about 3.6 %, but an increase in annual DC power by 87 %. Although this is attractive, such a case must be treated with caution since the likelihood of leaving this curtain (that is now more opaque than semi-transparent) open during sunshine hours is higher. This can result in a lower power output than the base case as well as worse aesthetics. Finally, it is concluded that a bifacial curtain is a beneficial for \u2018solarizing\u2019 existing buildings with minimal renovation. The bifacial aspect is best exploited for rooms with sub-optimal azimuths.

For the algorithmic filtering of items that are recommended to users, collaborative filtering techniques have been shown to give good performance in terms of accuracy. However, at the same time, they suffer from several drawbacks. Beyond the cold-start problem, which causes low recommendation quality for unpopular or newly added items and users, they also risk the creation of filter bubbles. Moreover, they tend to homogenise user preference and they recommend items with low content diversity.We argue that interactive recommenders can alleviate the problems because they, unlike the state-of-the-art, learn from all user interactions. We propose a method for combining interactive recommenders with the explorative capabilities of multi-armed bandit algorithms, which we use to formulate three explorative content-based recommenders. Using a simulation method, we evaluate them by analysing their accuracy, the diversity of recommendations and user preference, and the change in the distributions of preferences. The results show an increased content diversity, less homogenisation of preferences, and lower susceptibility to the formation of filter bubbles."",""subject topic"":""Recommender System; Interactive Learning; Multimedia retrieval"",""language"":""en"",""publication type"":""master thesis"",""publisher"":null,""isbn"":null,""issn"":null,""patent"":null,""patent status"":null,""bibliographic note"":null,""access restriction"":null,""embargo date"":null,""faculty"":null,""department"":null,""research group"":null,""programme"":null,""project"":null,""coordinates"":null},{""uuid"":""uuid:19ae2a31-5c22-4da0-9627-352a7e66a6b1"",""repository link"":""http:\/\/resolver.tudelft.nl\/uuid:19ae2a31-5c22-4da0-9627-352a7e66a6b1"",""title"":""Repetition counting in videos using deep learning"",""author"":""Batheja, Dhruv (TU Delft Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science)"",""contributor"":""van Gemert, Jan (mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)"",""publication year"":2019,""abstract"":""This work tackles the problem of repetition counting in videos using modern deep learning techniques.

A series of intermediate experiments are performed to eventually come up with an end-to-end trainable pipeline. Techniques like the University of California Riverside's Matrix profile, bi-directional recurrent neural networks and convolutional neural network architectures that employ dilation are experimented with for the task at hand. For the experiments, a variety of videos from the Qualcomm and University of Amsterdam (QUVA) repetition dataset and the YouTube Segments (YTSegments) dataset are used which both exhibit a good number of non-static videos of real life scenarios like people exercising, chopping vegetables, etc. A proprietary Aircraft inspection dataset which contains repetition of spinning engine blades is also experimented with. The proposed model obtains a lower Mean Absolute Error than the existing deep learning architectures. Finally, the model proposed in this work is able to estimate repetitions on a variety of videos successfully in real time without manual intervention.

Chemical phosphorus removal by iron dosing is commonly used for this purpose, where phosphorus is among others bound in the mineral vivianite (Fe(II)3[PO4]2 \u00b7 8 H2O). A molar Fe:P ratio of 2.5 in sludge will capture 70-90% of total phosphorus in vivianite after anaerobic digestion, a digestion method which offers ideal conditions for vivianite formation. Vivianite is paramagnetic, enabling it to be recovered by magnetic separation for recycling purposes. Phosphorus recycling from wastewater is of great importance, as in worst-case scenarios, 40-60% of all phosphate rock resources will be extracted by 2100. It is furthermore estimated that in Europe 20-30% of the fertilizer demand can be met by using phosphorus that ends up in sludge in European sewage treatment plants. To reduce processing costs of magnetic vivianite recovery, a pre-concentration step based on density concentration can be introduced, as vivianite particles are denser than organic material in sludge. This research investigated the feasibility of vivianite concentration from digested sewage sludge with a Multotec MX7 spiral concentrator. Spirals are applied in the mining industry for coal washing and pre-concentration of ores which are suspended in water. Particle separation on spirals is based on centrifugal and gravitational forces. Digested sewage sludge is more viscous than water, which affects the separation process on spiral concentrators. To investigate the influence of this high sludge viscosity on the spiral separation efficiency, laboratory experiments were performed. Diluting the sludge furthermore improved the concentration of solids towardsthe product flow. However, spiral efficiencies were only 9%, while efficiencies over 80% were found for synthetic sludge, meaning that particle separation was limited. The iron concentration was highest in the product outlet and increased with dilution. The phosphorus content, however, was similar for all outlets and dilutions, suggesting that only Fe minerals other than vivianite, such as siderite and pyrite, concentrated towards the product flow. Additionally, a concentrated bed of sand grains was observed near the column after a dilution of 20%. While diluting the sludge improved the concentration of sand and heavy Fe minerals, it did not induce vivianite concentration."",""subject topic"":""Phosphorus recovery; Density concentration; sewage sludge; Vivianite"",""language"":""en"",""publication type"":""master thesis"",""publisher"":null,""isbn"":null,""issn"":null,""patent"":null,""patent status"":null,""bibliographic note"":null,""access restriction"":null,""embargo date"":""2024-08-27"",""faculty"":null,""department"":null,""research group"":null,""programme"":null,""project"":null,""coordinates"":null},{""uuid"":""uuid:76aa9898-7edd-486c-969b-4e9425f51946"",""repository link"":""http:\/\/resolver.tudelft.nl\/uuid:76aa9898-7edd-486c-969b-4e9425f51946"",""title"":""Towards Decentralised Energy Systems: An Analysis of the Distribution of Tasks to Safeguard Essential Energy Sector's Public Values"",""author"":""Yosira Ayu Jawata, Yosi (TU Delft Technology, Policy and Management)"",""contributor"":""Doorn, Neelke (mentor); Cuppen, Eefje (mentor); Warnier, Martijn (mentor); Galeano Galvan, Maria (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)"",""publication year"":2019,""abstract"":null,""subject topic"":""Decentralised energy system; public values; distribution of tasks"",""language"":""en"",""publication type"":""master thesis"",""publisher"":null,""isbn"":null,""issn"":null,""patent"":null,""patent status"":null,""bibliographic note"":null,""access restriction"":null,""embargo date"":null,""faculty"":null,""department"":null,""research group"":null,""programme"":""Engineering and Policy Analysis"",""project"":null,""coordinates"":null},{""uuid"":""uuid:1cb58d76-a194-4a2f-b554-c172a8d3d78a"",""repository link"":""http:\/\/resolver.tudelft.nl\/uuid:1cb58d76-a194-4a2f-b554-c172a8d3d78a"",""title"":""Fetal cardiovascular simulations to assess the feasibility of intrauterine ECMO"",""author"":""Wachter, Esther (TU Delft Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering)"",""contributor"":""Dankelman, Jenny (mentor); Goos, Tom (mentor); Kok, Manon (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)"",""publication year"":2019,""abstract"":""The placenta is very important during the start of life, providing the fetus with oxygen and nutrients from the maternal blood. Impaired growth of the placenta and additional placental ischaemia endangers the exchange of gasses, exchange of nutrients, and optimal growth of the fetus. This thesis investigates the feasibility of intrauterine ECMO to improve oxygen levels in fetal blood during placental ischaemia. Fetal blood would be retrieved from the umbilical artery, oxygenated in the ECMO system and fed back into the umbilical artery. The objective of this thesis is to design a cardiovascular model to simulate the cardiovascular response to an ECMO support system. A lumped parameter model is created to approximate the fetal cardiovascular system. By performing a parameter search, haemodynamic parameters were gathered for the fetal model. Data from 30 week fetuses was used as initial input, because of parameter accessibility. Parameters for the gestational age of 20 to 29 weeks were obtained by extrapolating the parameters from the fetus of 30 weeks with scaling factors. A sensitivity analysis was performed to analyse the flow and pressure distribution through the fetal cardiovascular system and the cardiovascular response to different parameters. Implementation of a cannula into one of the umbilical arteries increases the resistance of that artery. Simulating the cardiovascular response to the addition of the cannula showed promising results for the feasibility of intrauterine ECMO. The fetal heart is able to maintain blood flow through the cannula despite the fact that the resistance of the artery is increased. The placental resistance increases during placental ischaemia. Because of this higher resistance, blood flow through the placenta will decrease. However, even at a lower flow rate, oxygenation of blood flow via the umbilical artery is mostly sufficient. The reason is the high percentage of fetal cardiac output flowing through the placental circulation. The designed model is able to simulate the fetal cardiovascular system and provides a simulation tool to further develop an intrauterine ECMO support system."",""subject topic"":""placental ischaemia; ECMO; lumped parameter model; fetal cardiovascular system"",""language"":""en"",""publication type"":""master thesis"",""publisher"":null,""isbn"":null,""issn"":null,""patent"":null,""patent status"":null,""bibliographic note"":null,""access restriction"":null,""embargo date"":null,""faculty"":null,""department"":null,""research group"":null,""programme"":null,""project"":null,""coordinates"":null},{""uuid"":""uuid:5028e05e-661f-4791-9d1f-e50d877aa24f"",""repository link"":""http:\/\/resolver.tudelft.nl\/uuid:5028e05e-661f-4791-9d1f-e50d877aa24f"",""title"":""Human Activity Recognition using a Deep Learning Algorithm for Patient Monitoring"",""author"":""Fri\u0111riksd\u00f3ttir, Esther (TU Delft Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering)"",""contributor"":""French, Paddy (mentor); Bonomi, Alberto (mentor); Hunyadi, Bori (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)"",""publication year"":2019,""abstract"":""Physical activity and mobility are important indicators of the recovery process of patients in the general ward of the hospital. Currently, monitoring mobility of hospitalized patients relies largely on direct observation from the caregivers. Accelerometers have the potential to quantify physical activity of patients objectively and without obstructing their daily routines. Human Activity Recognition (HAR) is a technique used to assess the type of activity an individual subject is carrying out based on sensor readings and has been extensively studied. However, the literature shows that HAR methodologies have been largely developed to recognize activities typical for healthy subjects. This means that activities performed at a slow and irregular pace, such as by a symptomatic patient or an elder, are scarcely considered to design HAR methods. Using HAR for patient monitoring would allow clinically meaningful metrics, such as time spent ambulating or in sedentary behaviour each day, to be obtained automatically. This may offer a convenient solution to enable caregivers automatically monitoring the recovery process of patients. The aim of this work was to develop an accurate HAR model to recognize activities typical for hospitalized patients. A data collection study was conducted with 20 healthy volunteers in a simulated hospital environment. A single triaxial accelerometer placed on the trunk was used to measure body movement and recognize seven activity types: Lying in bed, upright posture, walking, walking with walking aid, wheelchair transport, stair ascent and stair descent. Features from both time and frequency domain were extracted and used to train three machine learning (ML) classifiers (Na\u00efve Bayes, Random Forest, Support Vector Machine). Additionally, a deep neural network (DNN) consisting of a three convolutional layers and a Long Short-Term Memory layer was developed. The performance of the DNN model was evaluated on holdout data and compared to the performance of the feature-based ML classifiers. The DNN model reached a higher classification accuracy than the latter approaches (F1-score= 0.902 vs. 0.821). All the models showed a large number of misclassification between the walking with or without walking aid class. By combining these two classes the DNN model reached an F1-score 0.946, compared to F1-score 0.856 of the best feature-based ML approach represented by a support vector machine classifier. This work shows for the first time the value of applying deep-learning techniques to improve the accuracy of feature-based ML classifiers for addressing the problem of HAR using a single triaxial accelerometer in simulated hospital conditions."",""subject topic"":""Human Activity Recognition; Machine Learning; Deep Learning; Accelerometer; Classification; Patient Monitoring"",""language"":""en"",""publication type"":""master thesis"",""publisher"":null,""isbn"":null,""issn"":null,""patent"":null,""patent status"":null,""bibliographic note"":null,""access restriction"":null,""embargo date"":""2024-08-27"",""faculty"":null,""department"":null,""research group"":null,""programme"":null,""project"":null,""coordinates"":null},{""uuid"":""uuid:c35b03b1-72e7-4481-ad20-582302b25af9"",""repository link"":""http:\/\/resolver.tudelft.nl\/uuid:c35b03b1-72e7-4481-ad20-582302b25af9"",""title"":""Spanwise wall oscillation as a drag reduction technique: PIV-based evaluation of turbulent skin-friction drag reduction over a flat plate by spanwise wall oscillation"",""author"":""Ujjaini Kempaiah, Kushal (TU Delft Aerospace Engineering)"",""contributor"":""Scarano, F.

The business model of facades as a product service system is a promising strategy to change these practices. A pilot project at Delft University of Technology sparks the interest of Alkondor Hengelo, to explore their tasks and responsibilities as pioneers in this new way of supplying facades. Suppliers would retain the ownership of a leased PSS fa\u00e7ade and guide a project through its entire service life and beyond, managing materials in a circular way. The two main challenges were identified as 1. Going from a linear model to circularity, and 2. The ongoing involvement in a PSS instead of handing over their product. The first steps of implementing the fa\u00e7ade leasing model have been taken, however the full strategy yet needs to be outlined, to understand how value is added for suppliers and clients and where technical barriers are found.Objective - Ideally, a PSS would optimize fa\u00e7ade performance and provide all services that are needed to do so. This adds value for the client and creates a steady source of income for the supplier. As the pathway to a full PSS is best approached in smaller steps, it should be defined: What set of tasks would the fa\u00e7ade supplier take on in a basic stage of servitization, and what could be added on to form a more advanced service agreement? For fa\u00e7ade suppliers, it is important to make the best use of the investment into their product, as they would not only be acting as producers, but also operate and safeguard the product and its performance throughout the entire cradle-to-cradle life cycle. Therefore, it should be designed for optimal operation and output during use, and designed for circularity, to achieve a high residual value after the first use. Different design criteria and considerations are therefore given, as a reference for future designers of circular facades as PSS."",""subject topic"":""Facade; Circular facades; Product-Service System; Fa\u00e7ade Leasing; Reusable Facades"",""language"":""en"",""publication type"":""master thesis"",""publisher"":null,""isbn"":null,""issn"":null,""patent"":null,""patent status"":null,""bibliographic note"":null,""access restriction"":null,""embargo date"":null,""faculty"":null,""department"":null,""research group"":null,""programme"":null,""project"":null,""coordinates"":null},{""uuid"":""uuid:b1059caf-8eee-48d8-8a78-c14d3b0d7db3"",""repository link"":""http:\/\/resolver.tudelft.nl\/uuid:b1059caf-8eee-48d8-8a78-c14d3b0d7db3"",""title"":""Automated FPGA Hardware Synthesis for High-Throughput Big Data Filtering and Transformation: An SQL query transpiler targeting Vivado HLS C++ tools for high-level stream transformation and filtering on FPGAs using Apache Arrow."",""author"":""de Haan, Erwin (TU Delft Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science)"",""contributor"":""Al-Ars, Zaid (mentor); Hofstee, Peter (graduation committee); Rellermeyer, Jan (graduation committee); Peltenburg, Johan (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)"",""publication year"":2019,""abstract"":""Despite its advantages in performance and control, hardware design is mainly bottlenecked by high design complexity and long development time. This thesis explores the use of domain specific languages for high-level synthesis (HLS) of hardware data filters and transformations.The main goal of this thesis\u2019 prototype is automating the transpiling of SQL to HLS C++ to generate hardware for filtering and data streams using CAPI on POWER systems. This work uses the Fletcher framework to automate the handling of data movement between memory and the field-programmable gate array (FPGA). The use of HLS technologies can greatly reduce the development time of FPGAs compared to manual FPGA development workflows. Deploying FPGAs in fast changing data processing pipelines, can be very complicated or limit the use of the FPGA hardware. This work investigates if HLScan be used for these kinds of applications to reduce total development time while still maintaining performance. Additionally, the use of the Fletcher framework further reduces required developer time. The proof-of-concept shows that it is possible to efficiently use HLS for data filtering and transformations. And that without a significant effort from the designer, usable designs and filters can be generated. For example some of the simpler kernels can reach upwards of 1 GB\/s while using less than 1 % of a Xilinx Kintex UltraScale XCKU060 FPGA. By using multiple instances of these kernels the design can saturate the system bandwidth. Though this approach is not without issue, it does lend itself to extending the tool and some extra development effort to improve the current proof-of-concept.The project code is released under Apache 2.0 license on GitHub at: https:\/\/github.com\/EraYaN\/FletcherFiltering."",""subject topic"":""FPGA; HLS; SQL; compiler; automated; python"",""language"":""en"",""publication type"":""master thesis"",""publisher"":null,""isbn"":null,""issn"":null,""patent"":null,""patent status"":null,""bibliographic note"":null,""access restriction"":null,""embargo date"":null,""faculty"":null,""department"":null,""research group"":null,""programme"":null,""project"":null,""coordinates"":null},{""uuid"":""uuid:4e95d861-9e4b-4f54-96b6-ce82f92f7995"",""repository link"":""http:\/\/resolver.tudelft.nl\/uuid:4e95d861-9e4b-4f54-96b6-ce82f92f7995"",""title"":""Orthogonality relations of q-Meixner polynomials: with the use of spectral analysis"",""author"":""van Doesburg, Chiel (TU Delft Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science; TU Delft Analysis)"",""contributor"":""Groenevelt, Wolter (mentor); van Neerven, Jan (graduation committee); Kraaikamp, Cornelis (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)"",""publication year"":2019,""abstract"":""Orthogonality relations of q-Meixner polynomials, polynomials in terms of basic hypergeometric series, will be proved by using spectral measures and a difference operator."",""subject topic"":""q-Meixner polynomials; spectral analysis; Orthogonality relations"",""language"":""en"",""publication type"":""master thesis"",""publisher"":null,""isbn"":null,""issn"":null,""patent"":null,""patent status"":null,""bibliographic note"":null,""access restriction"":null,""embargo date"":null,""faculty"":null,""department"":null,""research group"":null,""programme"":null,""project"":null,""coordinates"":null},{""uuid"":""uuid:6e8fbe1d-55a9-4389-b32a-842ce9c4bedd"",""repository link"":""http:\/\/resolver.tudelft.nl\/uuid:6e8fbe1d-55a9-4389-b32a-842ce9c4bedd"",""title"":""African Market: Entry for a Trypanosomiasis Diagnostic Device"",""author"":""Bautista Gauna, Paola Montserrat (TU Delft Industrial Design Engineering)"",""contributor"":""Diehl, Jan-Carel (mentor); Brouwer, Willemijn (mentor); Vendel, Mirte (mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)"",""publication year"":2019,""abstract"":""This report is the result of a graduation project in the domain of the Africa Market Entry for a Trypanosomiasis Diagnostic Device. The project aims to find promising ways to bring to the market a portable diagnostic device for Trypanosomiasis, developed by the company Aidx Medical BV. The context of T. African Animal Trypanosomiasis (AAT) is a vector-borne parasitic disease. It is caused by infection with protozoan parasites belonging to the genus Trypanosoma. They are transmitted to animals & humans by tsetse fly bites which have acquired their infection from parasitaemic mammalian host. AAT is a major constraint to socio-economic development in Africa. AAT has significantly reduce productivity in over 150 million cattle and 260 million sheep and goats (Jahnke, Tacher, Kiel, & Rojat, 1988), and it is estimated to cause annual losses of more than US$ 4.5 billion dollars through direct and indirect agricultural production losses (Yaro, Munyard, Stear, & Groth, 2016). There are many barriers that complicates the access of trypanosomiasis (T) diagnostics and treatment such as lack of confirmatory test, large distances, limited trained staff and lack of laboratories facilities. The diagnosis of T is notoriously difficult, because the clinical signs are similar to other cattle diseases. Likewise, the only way to confirm a diagnosis is to demonstrate and identify parasites in body fluid. The current diagnostic practices require staff with strong proficiency and expertise, which the limits the reliability of the test. In addition, diagnostic technique for routine veterinary purposes is only suitable if it is cost-efficient. Therefore, there is a need for the new diagnostic test requiring minimum training, inexpensive and should provide rapid and reliable results. Business Modeling According to the research, the device had a strong value proposition on the market. Several business model prototypes were created and tested in a field trip to Uganda. In the field trip, it was discovered that the current technique of introducing medical devices (ex. microscopes) and drugs was through an intermediary. This intermediary may be a chain of pharmacies or a device seller that needs to be certified by the government to distribute and sell the devices or drugs. The intermediary takes also charge of the promotion and distribution of the product. The business model prototypes were redesigned with the new set of information. After an evaluation with the company, the most promising scenario was selected according to their aim, strengths and weakness. The main value of the company is to develop and manufacture an automatic diagnostic device for thick bone diseases that an unprofessional person can do a rapid and reliable diagnosis on the field. The customer segment is the government, because they are the largest employer in veterinary services delivery. The distribution channel will be through intermediaries, because they have a deep understand of the local market. As well, the company does not need a large capital investment on developing a distribution channel. The main revenue would be through asset sale of the diagnostic devices. The business model helped to outline the most important concepts of the company. Market Entry Strategy The business model helped to outline the important concepts of the company. Thereafter an International Market Entry was planned. This entailed the entry location (EL), entry timing (ET), and entry mode (EM). As it was previously explained, Aidx Medical BV will be the first mover and focused on a niche market on automated diagnostic device for veterinary health. Finally, the entry mode selected was indirect exports, meaning the company will sell the device through an intermediary. Finally, the strategy is described with the concept of 4P Marketing Mix (Mullins & Walker Jr., 2013)which includes product, price, place and promotion in conjunction the international entry market and the business model to ensure that the action plans within all are complimentary and aligned."",""subject topic"":""Business Model Canvas; Market Entry Strategy; 4PS Marketing Mix; African Market; Trypanosomiasis; Neglected Tropical Disease"",""language"":""en"",""publication type"":""master thesis"",""publisher"":null,""isbn"":null,""issn"":null,""patent"":null,""patent status"":null,""bibliographic note"":null,""access restriction"":null,""embargo date"":null,""faculty"":null,""department"":null,""research group"":null,""programme"":""Strategic Product Design"",""project"":null,""coordinates"":""1.37330, 32.29030""},{""uuid"":""uuid:3003d5d6-810a-40b4-8e5d-e41fc61fa17f"",""repository link"":""http:\/\/resolver.tudelft.nl\/uuid:3003d5d6-810a-40b4-8e5d-e41fc61fa17f"",""title"":""Inter- and intra-driver variability in lane change behaviour"",""author"":""Koppel, Christiaan (TU Delft Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering; TU Delft Cognitive Robotics)"",""contributor"":""Petermeijer, Bastiaan (mentor); Abbink, David (mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)"",""publication year"":2019,""abstract"":""Lane change manoeuvres are known to vary widely in lane change duration.

Two scenarios were used: a closing gap in the target lane and a constant gap in the target lane, with 15 repetitions per scenario. The results show high inter-driver and intra-driver variability, for both lane change duration (M=6.34 s SD-inter=0.90 s SD-intra=1.26 s) and steering behaviour (e.g. maximum steering wheel angle M=4.14 deg SD-inter=1.62 deg SD-intra=1.34 deg). The effect of the scenario was not significant for lane change duration and maximum steering wheel angles. Additionally, it was shown that lane change duration only has a medium correlation with the maximum steering wheel angle (Pearson R(585)=-.48, p\\textless0.001). Furthermore, the mean and variability of the lane change duration decreased when lane changes were initiated with a shorter distance to the slow lead vehicle. Concluding, the lane change duration does not fully determine steering behaviour during a lane change, making it an unsuitable metric for determining human-like lane change trajectories. It is therefore proposed to create trajectories based on steering behaviour. It seems that drivers exhibit high variability in lane change behaviour when spatio-temporal criticality with respect to traffic is low. Higher spatio-temporal criticality limits the mean and variability of the lane change duration. Future work should determine whether this variability is the result of driver preference or indifference. Additionally, future work should implement and test human-like lane change trajectories based on steering behaviour as opposed to lane change duration."",""subject topic"":""Lane change manoeuvre; Driving simulator; Driving behaviour; Human-like driving"",""language"":""en"",""publication type"":""master thesis"",""publisher"":null,""isbn"":null,""issn"":null,""patent"":null,""patent status"":null,""bibliographic note"":null,""access restriction"":null,""embargo date"":null,""faculty"":null,""department"":null,""research group"":null,""programme"":""Mechanical Engineering | Vehicle Engineering"",""project"":null,""coordinates"":null},{""uuid"":""uuid:87d1d976-a0ba-40d2-8fa4-437bd65c5b91"",""repository link"":""http:\/\/resolver.tudelft.nl\/uuid:87d1d976-a0ba-40d2-8fa4-437bd65c5b91"",""title"":""Transverse 3D Electrical Properties Tomography"",""author"":""An, Xin (TU Delft Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science; TU Delft Circuits and Systems)"",""contributor"":""Remis, Rob (mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)"",""publication year"":2019,""abstract"":""MR-based Electrical Properties Tomography (EPT) is a medical imaging modality to reconstruct the electrical conductivity and permittivity inside the human body based on the magnetic field data obtained from an MRI system. Currently, 2D CSI-EPT implementation is able to generate reliable reconstructions under special assumption of electromagnetic fields, while 3D implementation of CSI-EPT is able to achieve accurate reconstruction. However, much effort is needed to reduce computational cost for practical application in a MRI setting. Several experiments show that the radiofrequency(RF) fields on the midplane of an birdcage RF coil is E-polarized. In this study, we assume that RF field is E-polarised in the midplane of the RF birdcage coil and no other field assumptions are imposed. The electromagnetic fields relations governed by Maxwell\u2019s equations in the birdcage RF coil are simplified by the negligibletransverse electric fields into two equations, referred to as midplane equations. In order to find the parameters that satisfy the midplane equations, an objective function is created by evaluating the difference between the measured and modeled data. A novel alternating-direction iterative method is proposed for minimizing the multivariate objective function where the electrical properties of biological tissues are retrieved in an iterative \u2019fix-one-optimize-for-the-other\u2019 way. Within each iteration, a two-step procedure is conducted by updating electric field parameter and dielectric parameter in turn. Three different optimization algorithms are implemented for updating the electric field parameter. The magnetic fields data for numerical simulations are generated by placing a male head model or a longitudinal uniform head model insidea simulated magnetic resonance scanner. The proposed methods are demonstrated by reconstructions from the simulated data, which are in good agreement with true electrical properties values.

The first analysis phase consists of research about the sugar\u2019s source, the context of use, and the sugar\u2019s characteristics. Applying the Material Driven Design method stimulates to not take the granulated, brown Arenga sugar as given, but play with texture, shape and process to find a more suitable way to serve it. Synthesizing the insights into a Material Experience Vision and Design Criteria leads to a variety of ideas, categorised into 9 design directions. From those, 3 concepts are worked out. The stencil shaker concept makes use of the dark colour of the sugar and puts a surprise illustration, depicting the rainforest\u2019s biodiversity, on the milk foam of the caf\u00e9 guest\u2019s drink. The rainforest globe concept is a decorative, round sugar pot from glass, depicting the eco-system of the Arenga tree and the rainforest. The selected concept of the sugar block grater lets the user transform traditional, hard sugar blocks into flakes. A more specific vision is defined to develop this concept. The metaphor of a opening flower bud describes the desired user experience. The sugar should be perceived as natural and special. It is furthermore desired to let the caf\u00e9 guests explore the background story of the sugar and get actively involved in it, feeling curiosity, pleasant surprise and virtuousness. The final design proposal is a grater made out of bamboo, which is placed on the caf\u00e9\u2019s tables. It is filled with cylindrical sugar blocks with chocolate-like texture. The caf\u00e9 guest can grate sugar flakes by rotating the base of the grater. A mechanism turns and pushes the sugar blocks against a knife with two blades, shaving off a layered spiral of flakes. The sugar comes out at the top of the grater in the shape of a flower. The user can observe the sugar \u201cgrowing\u201d inside an illustration of the rainforest, which is engraved in the bamboo around. This lets the user experience how the sugar naturally grows inside the biodiverse rainforest in Indonesia, contrary to being cultivated in monoculture plantations. The background story of the sugar is illustrated with engravings on the outside of the greater, showing how the sugar is wild-harvested and processed. The caf\u00e9 guests become part of the process by grating their own sugar flakes to sweeten their drinks. This drives a sustainable system of rainforest and local farmers. The sugar is presented as special and natural, in an attractive and novel way. The concept is tested with a working prototype and evaluated by users and caf\u00e9s."",""subject topic"":""Integrated Product Design; Sustainability; Experience; Sugar; Material Driven Design; Food Design"",""language"":""en"",""publication type"":""master thesis"",""publisher"":null,""isbn"":null,""issn"":null,""patent"":null,""patent status"":null,""bibliographic note"":null,""access restriction"":null,""embargo date"":null,""faculty"":null,""department"":null,""research group"":null,""programme"":""Integrated Product Design"",""project"":null,""coordinates"":null},{""uuid"":""uuid:7a0b8590-2b97-4481-8b0d-0b832189ad88"",""repository link"":""http:\/\/resolver.tudelft.nl\/uuid:7a0b8590-2b97-4481-8b0d-0b832189ad88"",""title"":""Wall-Modelled Large Eddy Simulation of fully rough non-uniform flow for the purpose of predicting stone stability"",""author"":""NIKOLAIDOU, Lina (TU Delft Civil Engineering and Geosciences)"",""contributor"":""Uijttewaal, W.S.J.

According to the International Energy Agency (IEA), in 2018, the building sector alone constituted 28 % of all energy-related CO2 emissions. In an effort to reduce the carbon footprint of the building sector, the European Union has decreed that every new building from 2021 must be a nearly zero energy building where the low energy for such buildings must come from renewable sources. While this policy works well for new buildings, there needs to be also a solution developed for existing buildings or monumental buildings to be able to easily harness renewable energy, without the need for any major and costly renovation. The concept of a flexible cloth-based solar curtain as a plug and play solution for existing buildings has been explored in the current research, with particular focus on a bifacial (two-sided) design, to assess the significance of the indoor reflected daylight and artificial lights on the rear side power output of such a semi-transparent solar curtain. An optical model representing a basic semi-transparent curtain comprising 70 % cloth of roughly 62 % transparency (based on availability), and 30 % of bifacial solar photovoltaic (PV) minimodules, is prepared as a base case. To validate the optical model, it is replicated on a smaller scale and tested using an identical experimental setup in a controlled environment using a solar simulator. Four cases are prepared for this: the curtain in an empty white-walled room, the curtain in the same room but with some furniture, the curtain in a shorter room with a white rear wall and the curtain in a shorter room with a black rear wall. An analysis of simulation and experimental results shows near likeness between the two with an error margin of 3.3 % for the base case to 10.6 % for the black rear wall case. Slight non uniformity of optical property inputs used in the simulation model and an overestimation of experimentally measured power due to a relatively lower irradiance seen by the reference cell are attributed to this difference. After successful validation of the optical layout, the model is made to scale in simulations to forma PV curtain module of 538.44 Wp DC installed capacity. Using a north-east facing room as reference, an annual simulation is found to give a total DC energy yield of 188.45 kWh or 323 kWh\/kWp with a bifacial gain of 8.64 %. 10 hours daily of artificial lighting inside the office is seen to increase the annual DC energy yield by 1.33 %. With an assumption that the curtain remains closed throughout sunshine hours (since it allows diffuse light to enter through its porous cloth), the power output of the curtain is seen to meet modest DC annual load profiles of 57.76 kWh in an office room for 95 % of the year with a 145 Wh lithium ion battery bank and of 48.86 kWh in a residential room for 92%of the year, but with a much higher 290 Wh battery capacity, due to a greater mismatch between generation and demand. A sensitivity analysis for room orientation shows that for a more optimal azimuth of 202.5\u00b0 (180\u00b0 being south), the same curtain gives 82%more annual DC yield compared to its current orientation, but at a much lower bifacial gain of 7.8 %. When analyzed for performance in different locations across the world, the curtain intuitively gives the best yield for locations in the southern hemisphere due to its orientation towards the north east. Bifacial gain is nevertheless, most significant for temperate locations where low average annual insolation makes the gain due to bifacial more significant. In cases where the room depth is reduced by half, yield is seen to improve by 2.1 %. Halving the amount of PV in the curtain, improves the bifacial gain by nearly 0.6 % but reduces the annual yield by 49 %. Conversely, doubling the PV in the curtain, results in a dip in bifacial gain by about 3.6 %, but an increase in annual DC power by 87 %. Although this is attractive, such a case must be treated with caution since the likelihood of leaving this curtain (that is now more opaque than semi-transparent) open during sunshine hours is higher. This can result in a lower power output than the base case as well as worse aesthetics. Finally, it is concluded that a bifacial curtain is a beneficial for \u2018solarizing\u2019 existing buildings with minimal renovation. The bifacial aspect is best exploited for rooms with sub-optimal azimuths. Nevertheless, to make the most of the PV curtain, it is advised that itmust be placed in shorter rooms with large windows and ideally facing the most optimal direction."",""subject topic"":""Bifacial; BIPV; Photovoltaic; curtain"",""language"":""en"",""publication type"":""master thesis"",""publisher"":null,""isbn"":null,""issn"":null,""patent"":null,""patent status"":null,""bibliographic note"":null,""access restriction"":null,""embargo date"":""2019-08-27"",""faculty"":null,""department"":null,""research group"":null,""programme"":null,""project"":null,""coordinates"":null},{""uuid"":""uuid:0c3beb54-6263-4739-ae37-c589147f1dff"",""repository link"":""http:\/\/resolver.tudelft.nl\/uuid:0c3beb54-6263-4739-ae37-c589147f1dff"",""title"":""Interactive learning for multimedia archive exploration"",""author"":""Hammudo\u011flu, Joren (TU Delft Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science)"",""contributor"":""Liem, Cynthia (mentor); Scharenborg, Odette (graduation committee); Yorke-Smith, Neil (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)"",""publication year"":2019,""abstract"":""Recommender systems are essential for filtering immense amounts of available digital content.

However, at the same time, they suffer from several drawbacks. Beyond the cold-start problem, which causes low recommendation quality for unpopular or newly added items and users, they also risk the creation of filter bubbles. Moreover, they tend to homogenise user preference and they recommend items with low content diversity.We argue that interactive recommenders can alleviate the problems because they, unlike the state-of-the-art, learn from all user interactions. We propose a method for combining interactive recommenders with the explorative capabilities of multi-armed bandit algorithms, which we use to formulate three explorative content-based recommenders. Using a simulation method, we evaluate them by analysing their accuracy, the diversity of recommendations and user preference, and the change in the distributions of preferences.

Chemical phosphorus removal by iron dosing is commonly used for this purpose, where phosphorus is among others bound in the mineral vivianite (Fe(II)3[PO4]2 \u00b7 8 H2O). A molar Fe:P ratio of 2.5 in sludge will capture 70-90% of total phosphorus in vivianite after anaerobic digestion, a digestion method which offers ideal conditions for vivianite formation. Vivianite is paramagnetic, enabling it to be recovered by magnetic separation for recycling purposes. Phosphorus recycling from wastewater is of great importance, as in worst-case scenarios, 40-60% of all phosphate rock resources will be extracted by 2100. It is furthermore estimated that in Europe 20-30% of the fertilizer demand can be met by using phosphorus that ends up in sludge in European sewage treatment plants. To reduce processing costs of magnetic vivianite recovery, a pre-concentration step based on density concentration can be introduced, as vivianite particles are denser than organic material in sludge. This research investigated the feasibility of vivianite concentration from digested sewage sludge with a Multotec MX7 spiral concentrator. Spirals are applied in the mining industry for coal washing and pre-concentration of ores which are suspended in water. Particle separation on spirals is based on centrifugal and gravitational forces. Digested sewage sludge is more viscous than water, which affects the separation process on spiral concentrators. To investigate the influence of this high sludge viscosity on the spiral separation efficiency, laboratory experiments were performed. Diluting the sludge furthermore improved the concentration of solids towardsthe product flow. However, spiral efficiencies were only 9%, while efficiencies over 80% were found for synthetic sludge, meaning that particle separation was limited. The iron concentration was highest in the product outlet and increased with dilution. The phosphorus content, however, was similar for all outlets and dilutions, suggesting that only Fe minerals other than vivianite, such as siderite and pyrite, concentrated towards the product flow. Additionally, a concentrated bed of sand grains was observed near the column after a dilution of 20%. While diluting the sludge improved the concentration of sand and heavy Fe minerals, it did not induce vivianite concentration."",""subject topic"":""Phosphorus recovery; Density concentration; sewage sludge; Vivianite"",""language"":""en"",""publication type"":""master thesis"",""publisher"":null,""isbn"":null,""issn"":null,""patent"":null,""patent status"":null,""bibliographic note"":null,""access restriction"":null,""embargo date"":""2024-08-27"",""faculty"":null,""department"":null,""research group"":null,""programme"":null,""project"":null,""coordinates"":null},{""uuid"":""uuid:76aa9898-7edd-486c-969b-4e9425f51946"",""repository link"":""http:\/\/resolver.tudelft.nl\/uuid:76aa9898-7edd-486c-969b-4e9425f51946"",""title"":""Towards Decentralised Energy Systems: An Analysis of the Distribution of Tasks to Safeguard Essential Energy Sector's Public Values"",""author"":""Yosira Ayu Jawata, Yosi (TU Delft Technology, Policy and Management)"",""contributor"":""Doorn, Neelke (mentor); Cuppen, Eefje (mentor); Warnier, Martijn (mentor); Galeano Galvan, Maria (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)"",""publication year"":2019,""abstract"":null,""subject topic"":""Decentralised energy system; public values; distribution of tasks"",""language"":""en"",""publication type"":""master thesis"",""publisher"":null,""isbn"":null,""issn"":null,""patent"":null,""patent status"":null,""bibliographic note"":null,""access restriction"":null,""embargo date"":null,""faculty"":null,""department"":null,""research group"":null,""programme"":""Engineering and Policy Analysis"",""project"":null,""coordinates"":null},{""uuid"":""uuid:1cb58d76-a194-4a2f-b554-c172a8d3d78a"",""repository link"":""http:\/\/resolver.tudelft.nl\/uuid:1cb58d76-a194-4a2f-b554-c172a8d3d78a"",""title"":""Fetal cardiovascular simulations to assess the feasibility of intrauterine ECMO"",""author"":""Wachter, Esther (TU Delft Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering)"",""contributor"":""Dankelman, Jenny (mentor); Goos, Tom (mentor); Kok, Manon (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)"",""publication year"":2019,""abstract"":""The placenta is very important during the start of life, providing the fetus with oxygen and nutrients from the maternal blood. Impaired growth of the placenta and additional placental ischaemia endangers the exchange of gasses, exchange of nutrients, and optimal growth of the fetus. This thesis investigates the feasibility of intrauterine ECMO to improve oxygen levels in fetal blood during placental ischaemia. Fetal blood would be retrieved from the umbilical artery, oxygenated in the ECMO system and fed back into the umbilical artery. The objective of this thesis is to design a cardiovascular model to simulate the cardiovascular response to an ECMO support system. A lumped parameter model is created to approximate the fetal cardiovascular system. By performing a parameter search, haemodynamic parameters were gathered for the fetal model. Data from 30 week fetuses was used as initial input, because of parameter accessibility. Parameters for the gestational age of 20 to 29 weeks were obtained by extrapolating the parameters from the fetus of 30 weeks with scaling factors. A sensitivity analysis was performed to analyse the flow and pressure distribution through the fetal cardiovascular system and the cardiovascular response to different parameters. Implementation of a cannula into one of the umbilical arteries increases the resistance of that artery. Simulating the cardiovascular response to the addition of the cannula showed promising results for the feasibility of intrauterine ECMO. The fetal heart is able to maintain blood flow through the cannula despite the fact that the resistance of the artery is increased. The placental resistance increases during placental ischaemia. Because of this higher resistance, blood flow through the placenta will decrease. However, even at a lower flow rate, oxygenation of blood flow via the umbilical artery is mostly sufficient. The reason is the high percentage of fetal cardiac output flowing through the placental circulation. The designed model is able to simulate the fetal cardiovascular system and provides a simulation tool to further develop an intrauterine ECMO support system."",""subject topic"":""placental ischaemia; ECMO; lumped parameter model; fetal cardiovascular system"",""language"":""en"",""publication type"":""master thesis"",""publisher"":null,""isbn"":null,""issn"":null,""patent"":null,""patent status"":null,""bibliographic note"":null,""access restriction"":null,""embargo date"":null,""faculty"":null,""department"":null,""research group"":null,""programme"":null,""project"":null,""coordinates"":null},{""uuid"":""uuid:5028e05e-661f-4791-9d1f-e50d877aa24f"",""repository link"":""http:\/\/resolver.tudelft.nl\/uuid:5028e05e-661f-4791-9d1f-e50d877aa24f"",""title"":""Human Activity Recognition using a Deep Learning Algorithm for Patient Monitoring"",""author"":""Fri\u0111riksd\u00f3ttir, Esther (TU Delft Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering)"",""contributor"":""French, Paddy (mentor); Bonomi, Alberto (mentor); Hunyadi, Bori (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)"",""publication year"":2019,""abstract"":""Physical activity and mobility are important indicators of the recovery process of patients in the general ward of the hospital. Currently, monitoring mobility of hospitalized patients relies largely on direct observation from the caregivers. Accelerometers have the potential to quantify physical activity of patients objectively and without obstructing their daily routines. Human Activity Recognition (HAR) is a technique used to assess the type of activity an individual subject is carrying out based on sensor readings and has been extensively studied. However, the literature shows that HAR methodologies have been largely developed to recognize activities typical for healthy subjects. This means that activities performed at a slow and irregular pace, such as by a symptomatic patient or an elder, are scarcely considered to design HAR methods. Using HAR for patient monitoring would allow clinically meaningful metrics, such as time spent ambulating or in sedentary behaviour each day, to be obtained automatically. This may offer a convenient solution to enable caregivers automatically monitoring the recovery process of patients. The aim of this work was to develop an accurate HAR model to recognize activities typical for hospitalized patients. A data collection study was conducted with 20 healthy volunteers in a simulated hospital environment. A single triaxial accelerometer placed on the trunk was used to measure body movement and recognize seven activity types: Lying in bed, upright posture, walking, walking with walking aid, wheelchair transport, stair ascent and stair descent. Features from both time and frequency domain were extracted and used to train three machine learning (ML) classifiers (Na\u00efve Bayes, Random Forest, Support Vector Machine). Additionally, a deep neural network (DNN) consisting of a three convolutional layers and a Long Short-Term Memory layer was developed. The performance of the DNN model was evaluated on holdout data and compared to the performance of the feature-based ML classifiers. The DNN model reached a higher classification accuracy than the latter approaches (F1-score= 0.902 vs. 0.821). All the models showed a large number of misclassification between the walking with or without walking aid class. By combining these two classes the DNN model reached an F1-score 0.946, compared to F1-score 0.856 of the best feature-based ML approach represented by a support vector machine classifier. This work shows for the first time the value of applying deep-learning techniques to improve the accuracy of feature-based ML classifiers for addressing the problem of HAR using a single triaxial accelerometer in simulated hospital conditions."",""subject topic"":""Human Activity Recognition; Machine Learning; Deep Learning; Accelerometer; Classification; Patient Monitoring"",""language"":""en"",""publication type"":""master thesis"",""publisher"":null,""isbn"":null,""issn"":null,""patent"":null,""patent status"":null,""bibliographic note"":null,""access restriction"":null,""embargo date"":""2024-08-27"",""faculty"":null,""department"":null,""research group"":null,""programme"":null,""project"":null,""coordinates"":null},{""uuid"":""uuid:c35b03b1-72e7-4481-ad20-582302b25af9"",""repository link"":""http:\/\/resolver.tudelft.nl\/uuid:c35b03b1-72e7-4481-ad20-582302b25af9"",""title"":""Spanwise wall oscillation as a drag reduction technique: PIV-based evaluation of turbulent skin-friction drag reduction over a flat plate by spanwise wall oscillation"",""author"":""Ujjaini Kempaiah, Kushal (TU Delft Aerospace Engineering)"",""contributor"":""Scarano, F.

A pronounced drop of turbulence production in the range y+<\/sup> = [5, 30] is observed. The vorticity analysis indicates a distortion from the well-known hairpin-packet arrangement, suggesting that the mechanism of hairpin auto-generation may be inhibited by spanwise wall oscillations"",""subject topic"":""Experimental aerodynamics; PIV; Turbulence; skin-friction; drag; reduction; spanwise wall oscillation"",""language"":""en"",""publication type"":""master thesis"",""publisher"":null,""isbn"":null,""issn"":null,""patent"":null,""patent status"":null,""bibliographic note"":null,""access restriction"":null,""embargo date"":null,""faculty"":null,""department"":null,""research group"":null,""programme"":""Aerospace Engineering"",""project"":null,""coordinates"":null},{""uuid"":""uuid:56a2f8d7-fb26-40f0-bb92-00271f9492df"",""repository link"":""http:\/\/resolver.tudelft.nl\/uuid:56a2f8d7-fb26-40f0-bb92-00271f9492df"",""title"":""Optimizing the gradient ring of a low-field MRI scanner"",""author"":""Meijer, Angeline (TU Delft Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science; TU Delft Applied Sciences)"",""contributor"":""van Gijzen, Martin (mentor); van Dongen, Koen (mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)"",""publication year"":2019,""abstract"":""This report describes the study on the optimization of the magnetic field generated by a low-field magnetic resonance imaging modality.

The business model of facades as a product service system is a promising strategy to change these practices. A pilot project at Delft University of Technology sparks the interest of Alkondor Hengelo, to explore their tasks and responsibilities as pioneers in this new way of supplying facades. Suppliers would retain the ownership of a leased PSS fa\u00e7ade and guide a project through its entire service life and beyond, managing materials in a circular way. The two main challenges were identified as 1. Going from a linear model to circularity, and 2. The ongoing involvement in a PSS instead of handing over their product. The first steps of implementing the fa\u00e7ade leasing model have been taken, however the full strategy yet needs to be outlined, to understand how value is added for suppliers and clients and where technical barriers are found.Objective - Ideally, a PSS would optimize fa\u00e7ade performance and provide all services that are needed to do so. This adds value for the client and creates a steady source of income for the supplier. As the pathway to a full PSS is best approached in smaller steps, it should be defined: What set of tasks would the fa\u00e7ade supplier take on in a basic stage of servitization, and what could be added on to form a more advanced service agreement? For fa\u00e7ade suppliers, it is important to make the best use of the investment into their product, as they would not only be acting as producers, but also operate and safeguard the product and its performance throughout the entire cradle-to-cradle life cycle. Therefore, it should be designed for optimal operation and output during use, and designed for circularity, to achieve a high residual value after the first use. Different design criteria and considerations are therefore given, as a reference for future designers of circular facades as PSS."",""subject topic"":""Facade; Circular facades; Product-Service System; Fa\u00e7ade Leasing; Reusable Facades"",""language"":""en"",""publication type"":""master thesis"",""publisher"":null,""isbn"":null,""issn"":null,""patent"":null,""patent status"":null,""bibliographic note"":null,""access restriction"":null,""embargo date"":null,""faculty"":null,""department"":null,""research group"":null,""programme"":null,""project"":null,""coordinates"":null},{""uuid"":""uuid:b1059caf-8eee-48d8-8a78-c14d3b0d7db3"",""repository link"":""http:\/\/resolver.tudelft.nl\/uuid:b1059caf-8eee-48d8-8a78-c14d3b0d7db3"",""title"":""Automated FPGA Hardware Synthesis for High-Throughput Big Data Filtering and Transformation: An SQL query transpiler targeting Vivado HLS C++ tools for high-level stream transformation and filtering on FPGAs using Apache Arrow."",""author"":""de Haan, Erwin (TU Delft Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science)"",""contributor"":""Al-Ars, Zaid (mentor); Hofstee, Peter (graduation committee); Rellermeyer, Jan (graduation committee); Peltenburg, Johan (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)"",""publication year"":2019,""abstract"":""Despite its advantages in performance and control, hardware design is mainly bottlenecked by high design complexity and long development time. This thesis explores the use of domain specific languages for high-level synthesis (HLS) of hardware data filters and transformations.The main goal of this thesis\u2019 prototype is automating the transpiling of SQL to HLS C++ to generate hardware for filtering and data streams using CAPI on POWER systems. This work uses the Fletcher framework to automate the handling of data movement between memory and the field-programmable gate array (FPGA). The use of HLS technologies can greatly reduce the development time of FPGAs compared to manual FPGA development workflows. Deploying FPGAs in fast changing data processing pipelines, can be very complicated or limit the use of the FPGA hardware. This work investigates if HLScan be used for these kinds of applications to reduce total development time while still maintaining performance. Additionally, the use of the Fletcher framework further reduces required developer time. The proof-of-concept shows that it is possible to efficiently use HLS for data filtering and transformations. And that without a significant effort from the designer, usable designs and filters can be generated. For example some of the simpler kernels can reach upwards of 1 GB\/s while using less than 1 % of a Xilinx Kintex UltraScale XCKU060 FPGA. By using multiple instances of these kernels the design can saturate the system bandwidth. Though this approach is not without issue, it does lend itself to extending the tool and some extra development effort to improve the current proof-of-concept.The project code is released under Apache 2.0 license on GitHub at: https:\/\/github.com\/EraYaN\/FletcherFiltering."",""subject topic"":""FPGA; HLS; SQL; compiler; automated; python"",""language"":""en"",""publication type"":""master thesis"",""publisher"":null,""isbn"":null,""issn"":null,""patent"":null,""patent status"":null,""bibliographic note"":null,""access restriction"":null,""embargo date"":null,""faculty"":null,""department"":null,""research group"":null,""programme"":null,""project"":null,""coordinates"":null},{""uuid"":""uuid:4e95d861-9e4b-4f54-96b6-ce82f92f7995"",""repository link"":""http:\/\/resolver.tudelft.nl\/uuid:4e95d861-9e4b-4f54-96b6-ce82f92f7995"",""title"":""Orthogonality relations of q-Meixner polynomials: with the use of spectral analysis"",""author"":""van Doesburg, Chiel (TU Delft Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science; TU Delft Analysis)"",""contributor"":""Groenevelt, Wolter (mentor); van Neerven, Jan (graduation committee); Kraaikamp, Cornelis (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)"",""publication year"":2019,""abstract"":""Orthogonality relations of q-Meixner polynomials, polynomials in terms of basic hypergeometric series, will be proved by using spectral measures and a difference operator."",""subject topic"":""q-Meixner polynomials; spectral analysis; Orthogonality relations"",""language"":""en"",""publication type"":""master thesis"",""publisher"":null,""isbn"":null,""issn"":null,""patent"":null,""patent status"":null,""bibliographic note"":null,""access restriction"":null,""embargo date"":null,""faculty"":null,""department"":null,""research group"":null,""programme"":null,""project"":null,""coordinates"":null},{""uuid"":""uuid:6e8fbe1d-55a9-4389-b32a-842ce9c4bedd"",""repository link"":""http:\/\/resolver.tudelft.nl\/uuid:6e8fbe1d-55a9-4389-b32a-842ce9c4bedd"",""title"":""African Market: Entry for a Trypanosomiasis Diagnostic Device"",""author"":""Bautista Gauna, Paola Montserrat (TU Delft Industrial Design Engineering)"",""contributor"":""Diehl, Jan-Carel (mentor); Brouwer, Willemijn (mentor); Vendel, Mirte (mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)"",""publication year"":2019,""abstract"":""This report is the result of a graduation project in the domain of the Africa Market Entry for a Trypanosomiasis Diagnostic Device. The project aims to find promising ways to bring to the market a portable diagnostic device for Trypanosomiasis, developed by the company Aidx Medical BV. The context of T. African Animal Trypanosomiasis (AAT) is a vector-borne parasitic disease. It is caused by infection with protozoan parasites belonging to the genus Trypanosoma. They are transmitted to animals & humans by tsetse fly bites which have acquired their infection from parasitaemic mammalian host. AAT is a major constraint to socio-economic development in Africa. AAT has significantly reduce productivity in over 150 million cattle and 260 million sheep and goats (Jahnke, Tacher, Kiel, & Rojat, 1988), and it is estimated to cause annual losses of more than US$ 4.5 billion dollars through direct and indirect agricultural production losses (Yaro, Munyard, Stear, & Groth, 2016). There are many barriers that complicates the access of trypanosomiasis (T) diagnostics and treatment such as lack of confirmatory test, large distances, limited trained staff and lack of laboratories facilities. The diagnosis of T is notoriously difficult, because the clinical signs are similar to other cattle diseases. Likewise, the only way to confirm a diagnosis is to demonstrate and identify parasites in body fluid. The current diagnostic practices require staff with strong proficiency and expertise, which the limits the reliability of the test. In addition, diagnostic technique for routine veterinary purposes is only suitable if it is cost-efficient. Therefore, there is a need for the new diagnostic test requiring minimum training, inexpensive and should provide rapid and reliable results. Business Modeling According to the research, the device had a strong value proposition on the market. Several business model prototypes were created and tested in a field trip to Uganda. In the field trip, it was discovered that the current technique of introducing medical devices (ex. microscopes) and drugs was through an intermediary. This intermediary may be a chain of pharmacies or a device seller that needs to be certified by the government to distribute and sell the devices or drugs. The intermediary takes also charge of the promotion and distribution of the product. The business model prototypes were redesigned with the new set of information. After an evaluation with the company, the most promising scenario was selected according to their aim, strengths and weakness. The main value of the company is to develop and manufacture an automatic diagnostic device for thick bone diseases that an unprofessional person can do a rapid and reliable diagnosis on the field. The customer segment is the government, because they are the largest employer in veterinary services delivery. The distribution channel will be through intermediaries, because they have a deep understand of the local market. As well, the company does not need a large capital investment on developing a distribution channel. The main revenue would be through asset sale of the diagnostic devices. The business model helped to outline the most important concepts of the company. Market Entry Strategy The business model helped to outline the important concepts of the company. Thereafter an International Market Entry was planned. This entailed the entry location (EL), entry timing (ET), and entry mode (EM). As it was previously explained, Aidx Medical BV will be the first mover and focused on a niche market on automated diagnostic device for veterinary health. Finally, the entry mode selected was indirect exports, meaning the company will sell the device through an intermediary. Finally, the strategy is described with the concept of 4P Marketing Mix (Mullins & Walker Jr., 2013)which includes product, price, place and promotion in conjunction the international entry market and the business model to ensure that the action plans within all are complimentary and aligned."",""subject topic"":""Business Model Canvas; Market Entry Strategy; 4PS Marketing Mix; African Market; Trypanosomiasis; Neglected Tropical Disease"",""language"":""en"",""publication type"":""master thesis"",""publisher"":null,""isbn"":null,""issn"":null,""patent"":null,""patent status"":null,""bibliographic note"":null,""access restriction"":null,""embargo date"":null,""faculty"":null,""department"":null,""research group"":null,""programme"":""Strategic Product Design"",""project"":null,""coordinates"":""1.37330, 32.29030""},{""uuid"":""uuid:3003d5d6-810a-40b4-8e5d-e41fc61fa17f"",""repository link"":""http:\/\/resolver.tudelft.nl\/uuid:3003d5d6-810a-40b4-8e5d-e41fc61fa17f"",""title"":""Inter- and intra-driver variability in lane change behaviour"",""author"":""Koppel, Christiaan (TU Delft Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering; TU Delft Cognitive Robotics)"",""contributor"":""Petermeijer, Bastiaan (mentor); Abbink, David (mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)"",""publication year"":2019,""abstract"":""Lane change manoeuvres are known to vary widely in lane change duration. This is thought to be an effect of the surrounding vehicles and personal preference of drivers. However, little is known about the effect on steering behaviour during a lane change manoeuvre. Moreover, the relation of the effect of traffic to inter- and intra-driver variability is unknown. This study focuses on quantifying inter- and intra-driver variability in lane change duration and steering behaviour during lane changes in two different traffic scenarios. In an exploratory study, 21 participants drove 30 lane change manoeuvres in a 6 DoF moving base driving simulator. Two scenarios were used: a closing gap in the target lane and a constant gap in the target lane, with 15 repetitions per scenario. The results show high inter-driver and intra-driver variability, for both lane change duration (M=6.34 s SD-inter=0.90 s SD-intra=1.26 s) and steering behaviour (e.g. maximum steering wheel angle M=4.14 deg SD-inter=1.62 deg SD-intra=1.34 deg). The effect of the scenario was not significant for lane change duration and maximum steering wheel angles. Additionally, it was shown that lane change duration only has a medium correlation with the maximum steering wheel angle (Pearson R(585)=-.48, p\\textless0.001). Furthermore, the mean and variability of the lane change duration decreased when lane changes were initiated with a shorter distance to the slow lead vehicle. Concluding, the lane change duration does not fully determine steering behaviour during a lane change, making it an unsuitable metric for determining human-like lane change trajectories. It is therefore proposed to create trajectories based on steering behaviour. It seems that drivers exhibit high variability in lane change behaviour when spatio-temporal criticality with respect to traffic is low. Higher spatio-temporal criticality limits the mean and variability of the lane change duration. Future work should determine whether this variability is the result of driver preference or indifference. Additionally, future work should implement and test human-like lane change trajectories based on steering behaviour as opposed to lane change duration."",""subject topic"":""Lane change manoeuvre; Driving simulator; Driving behaviour; Human-like driving"",""language"":""en"",""publication type"":""master thesis"",""publisher"":null,""isbn"":null,""issn"":null,""patent"":null,""patent status"":null,""bibliographic note"":null,""access restriction"":null,""embargo date"":null,""faculty"":null,""department"":null,""research group"":null,""programme"":""Mechanical Engineering | Vehicle Engineering"",""project"":null,""coordinates"":null},{""uuid"":""uuid:87d1d976-a0ba-40d2-8fa4-437bd65c5b91"",""repository link"":""http:\/\/resolver.tudelft.nl\/uuid:87d1d976-a0ba-40d2-8fa4-437bd65c5b91"",""title"":""Transverse 3D Electrical Properties Tomography"",""author"":""An, Xin (TU Delft Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science; TU Delft Circuits and Systems)"",""contributor"":""Remis, Rob (mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)"",""publication year"":2019,""abstract"":""MR-based Electrical Properties Tomography (EPT) is a medical imaging modality to reconstruct the electrical conductivity and permittivity inside the human body based on the magnetic field data obtained from an MRI system. Currently, 2D CSI-EPT implementation is able to generate reliable reconstructions under special assumption of electromagnetic fields, while 3D implementation of CSI-EPT is able to achieve accurate reconstruction. However, much effort is needed to reduce computational cost for practical application in a MRI setting. Several experiments show that the radiofrequency(RF) fields on the midplane of an birdcage RF coil is E-polarized. In this study, we assume that RF field is E-polarised in the midplane of the RF birdcage coil and no other field assumptions are imposed. The electromagnetic fields relations governed by Maxwell\u2019s equations in the birdcage RF coil are simplified by the negligibletransverse electric fields into two equations, referred to as midplane equations. In order to find the parameters that satisfy the midplane equations, an objective function is created by evaluating the difference between the measured and modeled data. A novel alternating-direction iterative method is proposed for minimizing the multivariate objective function where the electrical properties of biological tissues are retrieved in an iterative \u2019fix-one-optimize-for-the-other\u2019 way. Within each iteration, a two-step procedure is conducted by updating electric field parameter and dielectric parameter in turn. Three different optimization algorithms are implemented for updating the electric field parameter. The magnetic fields data for numerical simulations are generated by placing a male head model or a longitudinal uniform head model insidea simulated magnetic resonance scanner. The proposed methods are demonstrated by reconstructions from the simulated data, which are in good agreement with true electrical properties values. The study concludes with the selection of the following culvert array existing of 24 culverts measuring 9 m by 9 m executed with bidirectional turbines. From an economic feasibility study, wherein, amongst other involved parameters, an installed capacity of 36 MW, a market price of electricity of \u20ac 0.13 per kilowatt hour for the first 15 years and \u20ac 0.049 per kilowatt hour for the second 15 years and a loan period of 15 years, follows a payback period of 15 years and a levelised cost of energy value of \u20ac 0.058 per kilowatt hour. The first analysis phase consists of research about the sugar\u2019s source, the context of use, and the sugar\u2019s characteristics. Applying the Material Driven Design method stimulates to not take the granulated, brown Arenga sugar as given, but play with texture, shape and process to find a more suitable way to serve it. Synthesizing the insights into a Material Experience Vision and Design Criteria leads to a variety of ideas, categorised into 9 design directions. From those, 3 concepts are worked out. The stencil shaker concept makes use of the dark colour of the sugar and puts a surprise illustration, depicting the rainforest\u2019s biodiversity, on the milk foam of the caf\u00e9 guest\u2019s drink. The rainforest globe concept is a decorative, round sugar pot from glass, depicting the eco-system of the Arenga tree and the rainforest. The selected concept of the sugar block grater lets the user transform traditional, hard sugar blocks into flakes. A more specific vision is defined to develop this concept. The metaphor of a opening flower bud describes the desired user experience. The sugar should be perceived as natural and special. It is furthermore desired to let the caf\u00e9 guests explore the background story of the sugar and get actively involved in it, feeling curiosity, pleasant surprise and virtuousness. The final design proposal is a grater made out of bamboo, which is placed on the caf\u00e9\u2019s tables. It is filled with cylindrical sugar blocks with chocolate-like texture. The caf\u00e9 guest can grate sugar flakes by rotating the base of the grater. A mechanism turns and pushes the sugar blocks against a knife with two blades, shaving off a layered spiral of flakes. The sugar comes out at the top of the grater in the shape of a flower. The user can observe the sugar \u201cgrowing\u201d inside an illustration of the rainforest, which is engraved in the bamboo around. This lets the user experience how the sugar naturally grows inside the biodiverse rainforest in Indonesia, contrary to being cultivated in monoculture plantations. The background story of the sugar is illustrated with engravings on the outside of the greater, showing how the sugar is wild-harvested and processed. The caf\u00e9 guests become part of the process by grating their own sugar flakes to sweeten their drinks. This drives a sustainable system of rainforest and local farmers. The sugar is presented as special and natural, in an attractive and novel way. The concept is tested with a working prototype and evaluated by users and caf\u00e9s."",""subject topic"":""Integrated Product Design; Sustainability; Experience; Sugar; Material Driven Design; Food Design"",""language"":""en"",""publication type"":""master thesis"",""publisher"":null,""isbn"":null,""issn"":null,""patent"":null,""patent status"":null,""bibliographic note"":null,""access restriction"":null,""embargo date"":null,""faculty"":null,""department"":null,""research group"":null,""programme"":""Integrated Product Design"",""project"":null,""coordinates"":null},{""uuid"":""uuid:7a0b8590-2b97-4481-8b0d-0b832189ad88"",""repository link"":""http:\/\/resolver.tudelft.nl\/uuid:7a0b8590-2b97-4481-8b0d-0b832189ad88"",""title"":""Wall-Modelled Large Eddy Simulation of fully rough non-uniform flow for the purpose of predicting stone stability"",""author"":""NIKOLAIDOU, Lina (TU Delft Civil Engineering and Geosciences)"",""contributor"":""Uijttewaal, W.S.J.

According to the International Energy Agency (IEA), in 2018, the building sector alone constituted 28 % of all energy-related CO2 emissions. In an effort to reduce the carbon footprint of the building sector, the European Union has decreed that every new building from 2021 must be a nearly zero energy building where the low energy for such buildings must come from renewable sources. While this policy works well for new buildings, there needs to be also a solution developed for existing buildings or monumental buildings to be able to easily harness renewable energy, without the need for any major and costly renovation. The concept of a flexible cloth-based solar curtain as a plug and play solution for existing buildings has been explored in the current research, with particular focus on a bifacial (two-sided) design, to assess the significance of the indoor reflected daylight and artificial lights on the rear side power output of such a semi-transparent solar curtain. An optical model representing a basic semi-transparent curtain comprising 70 % cloth of roughly 62 % transparency (based on availability), and 30 % of bifacial solar photovoltaic (PV) minimodules, is prepared as a base case. To validate the optical model, it is replicated on a smaller scale and tested using an identical experimental setup in a controlled environment using a solar simulator. Four cases are prepared for this: the curtain in an empty white-walled room, the curtain in the same room but with some furniture, the curtain in a shorter room with a white rear wall and the curtain in a shorter room with a black rear wall. An analysis of simulation and experimental results shows near likeness between the two with an error margin of 3.3 % for the base case to 10.6 % for the black rear wall case. Slight non uniformity of optical property inputs used in the simulation model and an overestimation of experimentally measured power due to a relatively lower irradiance seen by the reference cell are attributed to this difference. After successful validation of the optical layout, the model is made to scale in simulations to forma PV curtain module of 538.44 Wp DC installed capacity. Using a north-east facing room as reference, an annual simulation is found to give a total DC energy yield of 188.45 kWh or 323 kWh\/kWp with a bifacial gain of 8.64 %. 10 hours daily of artificial lighting inside the office is seen to increase the annual DC energy yield by 1.33 %. With an assumption that the curtain remains closed throughout sunshine hours (since it allows diffuse light to enter through its porous cloth), the power output of the curtain is seen to meet modest DC annual load profiles of 57.76 kWh in an office room for 95 % of the year with a 145 Wh lithium ion battery bank and of 48.86 kWh in a residential room for 92%of the year, but with a much higher 290 Wh battery capacity, due to a greater mismatch between generation and demand. A sensitivity analysis for room orientation shows that for a more optimal azimuth of 202.5\u00b0 (180\u00b0 being south), the same curtain gives 82%more annual DC yield compared to its current orientation, but at a much lower bifacial gain of 7.8 %. When analyzed for performance in different locations across the world, the curtain intuitively gives the best yield for locations in the southern hemisphere due to its orientation towards the north east. Bifacial gain is nevertheless, most significant for temperate locations where low average annual insolation makes the gain due to bifacial more significant. In cases where the room depth is reduced by half, yield is seen to improve by 2.1 %. Halving the amount of PV in the curtain, improves the bifacial gain by nearly 0.6 % but reduces the annual yield by 49 %. Conversely, doubling the PV in the curtain, results in a dip in bifacial gain by about 3.6 %, but an increase in annual DC power by 87 %. Although this is attractive, such a case must be treated with caution since the likelihood of leaving this curtain (that is now more opaque than semi-transparent) open during sunshine hours is higher. This can result in a lower power output than the base case as well as worse aesthetics. Finally, it is concluded that a bifacial curtain is a beneficial for \u2018solarizing\u2019 existing buildings with minimal renovation. The bifacial aspect is best exploited for rooms with sub-optimal azimuths. Nevertheless, to make the most of the PV curtain, it is advised that itmust be placed in shorter rooms with large windows and ideally facing the most optimal direction."",""subject topic"":""Bifacial; BIPV; Photovoltaic; curtain"",""language"":""en"",""publication type"":""master thesis"",""publisher"":null,""isbn"":null,""issn"":null,""patent"":null,""patent status"":null,""bibliographic note"":null,""access restriction"":null,""embargo date"":""2019-08-27"",""faculty"":null,""department"":null,""research group"":null,""programme"":null,""project"":null,""coordinates"":null},{""uuid"":""uuid:0c3beb54-6263-4739-ae37-c589147f1dff"",""repository link"":""http:\/\/resolver.tudelft.nl\/uuid:0c3beb54-6263-4739-ae37-c589147f1dff"",""title"":""Interactive learning for multimedia archive exploration"",""author"":""Hammudo\u011flu, Joren (TU Delft Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science)"",""contributor"":""Liem, Cynthia (mentor); Scharenborg, Odette (graduation committee); Yorke-Smith, Neil (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)"",""publication year"":2019,""abstract"":""Recommender systems are essential for filtering immense amounts of available digital content. As these quantities keep increasing, the impact of recommendations does so as well. In this work, we address negative impacts current state-of-the-art recommenders have. For the algorithmic filtering of items that are recommended to users, collaborative filtering techniques have been shown to give good performance in terms of accuracy. However, at the same time, they suffer from several drawbacks. Beyond the cold-start problem, which causes low recommendation quality for unpopular or newly added items and users, they also risk the creation of filter bubbles. Moreover, they tend to homogenise user preference and they recommend items with low content diversity.We argue that interactive recommenders can alleviate the problems because they, unlike the state-of-the-art, learn from all user interactions. We propose a method for combining interactive recommenders with the explorative capabilities of multi-armed bandit algorithms, which we use to formulate three explorative content-based recommenders. Using a simulation method, we evaluate them by analysing their accuracy, the diversity of recommendations and user preference, and the change in the distributions of preferences. The results show an increased content diversity, less homogenisation of preferences, and lower susceptibility to the formation of filter bubbles."",""subject topic"":""Recommender System; Interactive Learning; Multimedia retrieval"",""language"":""en"",""publication type"":""master thesis"",""publisher"":null,""isbn"":null,""issn"":null,""patent"":null,""patent status"":null,""bibliographic note"":null,""access restriction"":null,""embargo date"":null,""faculty"":null,""department"":null,""research group"":null,""programme"":null,""project"":null,""coordinates"":null},{""uuid"":""uuid:19ae2a31-5c22-4da0-9627-352a7e66a6b1"",""repository link"":""http:\/\/resolver.tudelft.nl\/uuid:19ae2a31-5c22-4da0-9627-352a7e66a6b1"",""title"":""Repetition counting in videos using deep learning"",""author"":""Batheja, Dhruv (TU Delft Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science)"",""contributor"":""van Gemert, Jan (mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)"",""publication year"":2019,""abstract"":""This work tackles the problem of repetition counting in videos using modern deep learning techniques. For this task, the intention is to build an end-to-end trainable model that could estimate the number of repetitions without having to manually intervene with the feature selection process. The models that exist currently perform well on videos which are stationary but, realistic videos are rarely perfectly static. A series of intermediate experiments are performed to eventually come up with an end-to-end trainable pipeline. Techniques like the University of California Riverside's Matrix profile, bi-directional recurrent neural networks and convolutional neural network architectures that employ dilation are experimented with for the task at hand. For the experiments, a variety of videos from the Qualcomm and University of Amsterdam (QUVA) repetition dataset and the YouTube Segments (YTSegments) dataset are used which both exhibit a good number of non-static videos of real life scenarios like people exercising, chopping vegetables, etc. A proprietary Aircraft inspection dataset which contains repetition of spinning engine blades is also experimented with. The proposed model obtains a lower Mean Absolute Error than the existing deep learning architectures. Finally, the model proposed in this work is able to estimate repetitions on a variety of videos successfully in real time without manual intervention. On the task of repetition estimation, an accuracy of about 60% of correctly labelled frames (with repetitions so far) on unseen test videos is obtained."",""subject topic"":""Deep Learning; Matrix Profile; Backpropagation; LSTM; TCN; Videos; Python; Pytorch; CNN"",""language"":""en"",""publication type"":""master thesis"",""publisher"":null,""isbn"":null,""issn"":null,""patent"":null,""patent status"":null,""bibliographic note"":null,""access restriction"":null,""embargo date"":null,""faculty"":null,""department"":null,""research group"":null,""programme"":""Computer Science"",""project"":null,""coordinates"":null},{""uuid"":""uuid:9ab4f7c5-f6f4-42b4-b9bc-29fc01669523"",""repository link"":""http:\/\/resolver.tudelft.nl\/uuid:9ab4f7c5-f6f4-42b4-b9bc-29fc01669523"",""title"":""Phosphate Recovery from Sewage Sludge by Density Concentration"",""author"":""Koomen, Stef (TU Delft Civil Engineering and Geosciences; TU Delft Resource Engineering; TU Delft Resources & Recycling)"",""contributor"":""Rem, Peter (mentor); Buxton, Mike (graduation committee); Bakker, Maarten (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)"",""publication year"":2019,""abstract"":""Phosphate is removed from wastewater to prevent eutrophication. Chemical phosphorus removal by iron dosing is commonly used for this purpose, where phosphorus is among others bound in the mineral vivianite (Fe(II)3[PO4]2 \u00b7 8 H2O). A molar Fe:P ratio of 2.5 in sludge will capture 70-90% of total phosphorus in vivianite after anaerobic digestion, a digestion method which offers ideal conditions for vivianite formation. Vivianite is paramagnetic, enabling it to be recovered by magnetic separation for recycling purposes. Phosphorus recycling from wastewater is of great importance, as in worst-case scenarios, 40-60% of all phosphate rock resources will be extracted by 2100. It is furthermore estimated that in Europe 20-30% of the fertilizer demand can be met by using phosphorus that ends up in sludge in European sewage treatment plants. To reduce processing costs of magnetic vivianite recovery, a pre-concentration step based on density concentration can be introduced, as vivianite particles are denser than organic material in sludge. This research investigated the feasibility of vivianite concentration from digested sewage sludge with a Multotec MX7 spiral concentrator. Spirals are applied in the mining industry for coal washing and pre-concentration of ores which are suspended in water. Particle separation on spirals is based on centrifugal and gravitational forces. Digested sewage sludge is more viscous than water, which affects the separation process on spiral concentrators. To investigate the influence of this high sludge viscosity on the spiral separation efficiency, laboratory experiments were performed. Diluting the sludge furthermore improved the concentration of solids towardsthe product flow. However, spiral efficiencies were only 9%, while efficiencies over 80% were found for synthetic sludge, meaning that particle separation was limited. The iron concentration was highest in the product outlet and increased with dilution. The phosphorus content, however, was similar for all outlets and dilutions, suggesting that only Fe minerals other than vivianite, such as siderite and pyrite, concentrated towards the product flow. Additionally, a concentrated bed of sand grains was observed near the column after a dilution of 20%. While diluting the sludge improved the concentration of sand and heavy Fe minerals, it did not induce vivianite concentration."",""subject topic"":""Phosphorus recovery; Density concentration; sewage sludge; Vivianite"",""language"":""en"",""publication type"":""master thesis"",""publisher"":null,""isbn"":null,""issn"":null,""patent"":null,""patent status"":null,""bibliographic note"":null,""access restriction"":null,""embargo date"":""2024-08-27"",""faculty"":null,""department"":null,""research group"":null,""programme"":null,""project"":null,""coordinates"":null},{""uuid"":""uuid:76aa9898-7edd-486c-969b-4e9425f51946"",""repository link"":""http:\/\/resolver.tudelft.nl\/uuid:76aa9898-7edd-486c-969b-4e9425f51946"",""title"":""Towards Decentralised Energy Systems: An Analysis of the Distribution of Tasks to Safeguard Essential Energy Sector's Public Values"",""author"":""Yosira Ayu Jawata, Yosi (TU Delft Technology, Policy and Management)"",""contributor"":""Doorn, Neelke (mentor); Cuppen, Eefje (mentor); Warnier, Martijn (mentor); Galeano Galvan, Maria (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)"",""publication year"":2019,""abstract"":null,""subject topic"":""Decentralised energy system; public values; distribution of tasks"",""language"":""en"",""publication type"":""master thesis"",""publisher"":null,""isbn"":null,""issn"":null,""patent"":null,""patent status"":null,""bibliographic note"":null,""access restriction"":null,""embargo date"":null,""faculty"":null,""department"":null,""research group"":null,""programme"":""Engineering and Policy Analysis"",""project"":null,""coordinates"":null},{""uuid"":""uuid:1cb58d76-a194-4a2f-b554-c172a8d3d78a"",""repository link"":""http:\/\/resolver.tudelft.nl\/uuid:1cb58d76-a194-4a2f-b554-c172a8d3d78a"",""title"":""Fetal cardiovascular simulations to assess the feasibility of intrauterine ECMO"",""author"":""Wachter, Esther (TU Delft Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering)"",""contributor"":""Dankelman, Jenny (mentor); Goos, Tom (mentor); Kok, Manon (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)"",""publication year"":2019,""abstract"":""The placenta is very important during the start of life, providing the fetus with oxygen and nutrients from the maternal blood. Impaired growth of the placenta and additional placental ischaemia endangers the exchange of gasses, exchange of nutrients, and optimal growth of the fetus. This thesis investigates the feasibility of intrauterine ECMO to improve oxygen levels in fetal blood during placental ischaemia. Fetal blood would be retrieved from the umbilical artery, oxygenated in the ECMO system and fed back into the umbilical artery. The objective of this thesis is to design a cardiovascular model to simulate the cardiovascular response to an ECMO support system. A lumped parameter model is created to approximate the fetal cardiovascular system. By performing a parameter search, haemodynamic parameters were gathered for the fetal model. Data from 30 week fetuses was used as initial input, because of parameter accessibility. Parameters for the gestational age of 20 to 29 weeks were obtained by extrapolating the parameters from the fetus of 30 weeks with scaling factors. A sensitivity analysis was performed to analyse the flow and pressure distribution through the fetal cardiovascular system and the cardiovascular response to different parameters. Implementation of a cannula into one of the umbilical arteries increases the resistance of that artery. Simulating the cardiovascular response to the addition of the cannula showed promising results for the feasibility of intrauterine ECMO. The fetal heart is able to maintain blood flow through the cannula despite the fact that the resistance of the artery is increased. The placental resistance increases during placental ischaemia. Because of this higher resistance, blood flow through the placenta will decrease. However, even at a lower flow rate, oxygenation of blood flow via the umbilical artery is mostly sufficient. The reason is the high percentage of fetal cardiac output flowing through the placental circulation. The designed model is able to simulate the fetal cardiovascular system and provides a simulation tool to further develop an intrauterine ECMO support system."",""subject topic"":""placental ischaemia; ECMO; lumped parameter model; fetal cardiovascular system"",""language"":""en"",""publication type"":""master thesis"",""publisher"":null,""isbn"":null,""issn"":null,""patent"":null,""patent status"":null,""bibliographic note"":null,""access restriction"":null,""embargo date"":null,""faculty"":null,""department"":null,""research group"":null,""programme"":null,""project"":null,""coordinates"":null},{""uuid"":""uuid:5028e05e-661f-4791-9d1f-e50d877aa24f"",""repository link"":""http:\/\/resolver.tudelft.nl\/uuid:5028e05e-661f-4791-9d1f-e50d877aa24f"",""title"":""Human Activity Recognition using a Deep Learning Algorithm for Patient Monitoring"",""author"":""Fri\u0111riksd\u00f3ttir, Esther (TU Delft Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering)"",""contributor"":""French, Paddy (mentor); Bonomi, Alberto (mentor); Hunyadi, Bori (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)"",""publication year"":2019,""abstract"":""Physical activity and mobility are important indicators of the recovery process of patients in the general ward of the hospital. Currently, monitoring mobility of hospitalized patients relies largely on direct observation from the caregivers. Accelerometers have the potential to quantify physical activity of patients objectively and without obstructing their daily routines. Human Activity Recognition (HAR) is a technique used to assess the type of activity an individual subject is carrying out based on sensor readings and has been extensively studied. However, the literature shows that HAR methodologies have been largely developed to recognize activities typical for healthy subjects. This means that activities performed at a slow and irregular pace, such as by a symptomatic patient or an elder, are scarcely considered to design HAR methods. Using HAR for patient monitoring would allow clinically meaningful metrics, such as time spent ambulating or in sedentary behaviour each day, to be obtained automatically. This may offer a convenient solution to enable caregivers automatically monitoring the recovery process of patients. The aim of this work was to develop an accurate HAR model to recognize activities typical for hospitalized patients. A data collection study was conducted with 20 healthy volunteers in a simulated hospital environment. A single triaxial accelerometer placed on the trunk was used to measure body movement and recognize seven activity types: Lying in bed, upright posture, walking, walking with walking aid, wheelchair transport, stair ascent and stair descent. Features from both time and frequency domain were extracted and used to train three machine learning (ML) classifiers (Na\u00efve Bayes, Random Forest, Support Vector Machine). Additionally, a deep neural network (DNN) consisting of a three convolutional layers and a Long Short-Term Memory layer was developed. The performance of the DNN model was evaluated on holdout data and compared to the performance of the feature-based ML classifiers. The DNN model reached a higher classification accuracy than the latter approaches (F1-score= 0.902 vs. 0.821). All the models showed a large number of misclassification between the walking with or without walking aid class. By combining these two classes the DNN model reached an F1-score 0.946, compared to F1-score 0.856 of the best feature-based ML approach represented by a support vector machine classifier. This work shows for the first time the value of applying deep-learning techniques to improve the accuracy of feature-based ML classifiers for addressing the problem of HAR using a single triaxial accelerometer in simulated hospital conditions."",""subject topic"":""Human Activity Recognition; Machine Learning; Deep Learning; Accelerometer; Classification; Patient Monitoring"",""language"":""en"",""publication type"":""master thesis"",""publisher"":null,""isbn"":null,""issn"":null,""patent"":null,""patent status"":null,""bibliographic note"":null,""access restriction"":null,""embargo date"":""2024-08-27"",""faculty"":null,""department"":null,""research group"":null,""programme"":null,""project"":null,""coordinates"":null},{""uuid"":""uuid:c35b03b1-72e7-4481-ad20-582302b25af9"",""repository link"":""http:\/\/resolver.tudelft.nl\/uuid:c35b03b1-72e7-4481-ad20-582302b25af9"",""title"":""Spanwise wall oscillation as a drag reduction technique: PIV-based evaluation of turbulent skin-friction drag reduction over a flat plate by spanwise wall oscillation"",""author"":""Ujjaini Kempaiah, Kushal (TU Delft Aerospace Engineering)"",""contributor"":""Scarano, F.

The business model of facades as a product service system is a promising strategy to change these practices. A pilot project at Delft University of Technology sparks the interest of Alkondor Hengelo, to explore their tasks and responsibilities as pioneers in this new way of supplying facades. Suppliers would retain the ownership of a leased PSS fa\u00e7ade and guide a project through its entire service life and beyond, managing materials in a circular way. The two main challenges were identified as 1. Going from a linear model to circularity, and 2. The ongoing involvement in a PSS instead of handing over their product. The first steps of implementing the fa\u00e7ade leasing model have been taken, however the full strategy yet needs to be outlined, to understand how value is added for suppliers and clients and where technical barriers are found.Objective - Ideally, a PSS would optimize fa\u00e7ade performance and provide all services that are needed to do so. This adds value for the client and creates a steady source of income for the supplier. As the pathway to a full PSS is best approached in smaller steps, it should be defined: What set of tasks would the fa\u00e7ade supplier take on in a basic stage of servitization, and what could be added on to form a more advanced service agreement? For fa\u00e7ade suppliers, it is important to make the best use of the investment into their product, as they would not only be acting as producers, but also operate and safeguard the product and its performance throughout the entire cradle-to-cradle life cycle. Therefore, it should be designed for optimal operation and output during use, and designed for circularity, to achieve a high residual value after the first use. Different design criteria and considerations are therefore given, as a reference for future designers of circular facades as PSS."",""subject topic"":""Facade; Circular facades; Product-Service System; Fa\u00e7ade Leasing; Reusable Facades"",""language"":""en"",""publication type"":""master thesis"",""publisher"":null,""isbn"":null,""issn"":null,""patent"":null,""patent status"":null,""bibliographic note"":null,""access restriction"":null,""embargo date"":null,""faculty"":null,""department"":null,""research group"":null,""programme"":null,""project"":null,""coordinates"":null},{""uuid"":""uuid:b1059caf-8eee-48d8-8a78-c14d3b0d7db3"",""repository link"":""http:\/\/resolver.tudelft.nl\/uuid:b1059caf-8eee-48d8-8a78-c14d3b0d7db3"",""title"":""Automated FPGA Hardware Synthesis for High-Throughput Big Data Filtering and Transformation: An SQL query transpiler targeting Vivado HLS C++ tools for high-level stream transformation and filtering on FPGAs using Apache Arrow."",""author"":""de Haan, Erwin (TU Delft Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science)"",""contributor"":""Al-Ars, Zaid (mentor); Hofstee, Peter (graduation committee); Rellermeyer, Jan (graduation committee); Peltenburg, Johan (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)"",""publication year"":2019,""abstract"":""Despite its advantages in performance and control, hardware design is mainly bottlenecked by high design complexity and long development time. This thesis explores the use of domain specific languages for high-level synthesis (HLS) of hardware data filters and transformations.The main goal of this thesis\u2019 prototype is automating the transpiling of SQL to HLS C++ to generate hardware for filtering and data streams using CAPI on POWER systems. This work uses the Fletcher framework to automate the handling of data movement between memory and the field-programmable gate array (FPGA). The use of HLS technologies can greatly reduce the development time of FPGAs compared to manual FPGA development workflows. Deploying FPGAs in fast changing data processing pipelines, can be very complicated or limit the use of the FPGA hardware. This work investigates if HLScan be used for these kinds of applications to reduce total development time while still maintaining performance. Additionally, the use of the Fletcher framework further reduces required developer time. The proof-of-concept shows that it is possible to efficiently use HLS for data filtering and transformations. And that without a significant effort from the designer, usable designs and filters can be generated. For example some of the simpler kernels can reach upwards of 1 GB\/s while using less than 1 % of a Xilinx Kintex UltraScale XCKU060 FPGA. By using multiple instances of these kernels the design can saturate the system bandwidth. Though this approach is not without issue, it does lend itself to extending the tool and some extra development effort to improve the current proof-of-concept.The project code is released under Apache 2.0 license on GitHub at: https:\/\/github.com\/EraYaN\/FletcherFiltering."",""subject topic"":""FPGA; HLS; SQL; compiler; automated; python"",""language"":""en"",""publication type"":""master thesis"",""publisher"":null,""isbn"":null,""issn"":null,""patent"":null,""patent status"":null,""bibliographic note"":null,""access restriction"":null,""embargo date"":null,""faculty"":null,""department"":null,""research group"":null,""programme"":null,""project"":null,""coordinates"":null},{""uuid"":""uuid:4e95d861-9e4b-4f54-96b6-ce82f92f7995"",""repository link"":""http:\/\/resolver.tudelft.nl\/uuid:4e95d861-9e4b-4f54-96b6-ce82f92f7995"",""title"":""Orthogonality relations of q-Meixner polynomials: with the use of spectral analysis"",""author"":""van Doesburg, Chiel (TU Delft Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science; TU Delft Analysis)"",""contributor"":""Groenevelt, Wolter (mentor); van Neerven, Jan (graduation committee); Kraaikamp, Cornelis (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)"",""publication year"":2019,""abstract"":""Orthogonality relations of q-Meixner polynomials, polynomials in terms of basic hypergeometric series, will be proved by using spectral measures and a difference operator."",""subject topic"":""q-Meixner polynomials; spectral analysis; Orthogonality relations"",""language"":""en"",""publication type"":""master thesis"",""publisher"":null,""isbn"":null,""issn"":null,""patent"":null,""patent status"":null,""bibliographic note"":null,""access restriction"":null,""embargo date"":null,""faculty"":null,""department"":null,""research group"":null,""programme"":null,""project"":null,""coordinates"":null},{""uuid"":""uuid:6e8fbe1d-55a9-4389-b32a-842ce9c4bedd"",""repository link"":""http:\/\/resolver.tudelft.nl\/uuid:6e8fbe1d-55a9-4389-b32a-842ce9c4bedd"",""title"":""African Market: Entry for a Trypanosomiasis Diagnostic Device"",""author"":""Bautista Gauna, Paola Montserrat (TU Delft Industrial Design Engineering)"",""contributor"":""Diehl, Jan-Carel (mentor); Brouwer, Willemijn (mentor); Vendel, Mirte (mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)"",""publication year"":2019,""abstract"":""This report is the result of a graduation project in the domain of the Africa Market Entry for a Trypanosomiasis Diagnostic Device. The project aims to find promising ways to bring to the market a portable diagnostic device for Trypanosomiasis, developed by the company Aidx Medical BV. The context of T. African Animal Trypanosomiasis (AAT) is a vector-borne parasitic disease. It is caused by infection with protozoan parasites belonging to the genus Trypanosoma. They are transmitted to animals & humans by tsetse fly bites which have acquired their infection from parasitaemic mammalian host. AAT is a major constraint to socio-economic development in Africa. AAT has significantly reduce productivity in over 150 million cattle and 260 million sheep and goats (Jahnke, Tacher, Kiel, & Rojat, 1988), and it is estimated to cause annual losses of more than US$ 4.5 billion dollars through direct and indirect agricultural production losses (Yaro, Munyard, Stear, & Groth, 2016). There are many barriers that complicates the access of trypanosomiasis (T) diagnostics and treatment such as lack of confirmatory test, large distances, limited trained staff and lack of laboratories facilities. The diagnosis of T is notoriously difficult, because the clinical signs are similar to other cattle diseases. Likewise, the only way to confirm a diagnosis is to demonstrate and identify parasites in body fluid. The current diagnostic practices require staff with strong proficiency and expertise, which the limits the reliability of the test. In addition, diagnostic technique for routine veterinary purposes is only suitable if it is cost-efficient. Therefore, there is a need for the new diagnostic test requiring minimum training, inexpensive and should provide rapid and reliable results. Business Modeling According to the research, the device had a strong value proposition on the market. Several business model prototypes were created and tested in a field trip to Uganda. In the field trip, it was discovered that the current technique of introducing medical devices (ex. microscopes) and drugs was through an intermediary. This intermediary may be a chain of pharmacies or a device seller that needs to be certified by the government to distribute and sell the devices or drugs. The intermediary takes also charge of the promotion and distribution of the product. The business model prototypes were redesigned with the new set of information. After an evaluation with the company, the most promising scenario was selected according to their aim, strengths and weakness. The main value of the company is to develop and manufacture an automatic diagnostic device for thick bone diseases that an unprofessional person can do a rapid and reliable diagnosis on the field. The customer segment is the government, because they are the largest employer in veterinary services delivery. The distribution channel will be through intermediaries, because they have a deep understand of the local market. As well, the company does not need a large capital investment on developing a distribution channel. The main revenue would be through asset sale of the diagnostic devices. The business model helped to outline the most important concepts of the company. Market Entry Strategy The business model helped to outline the important concepts of the company. Thereafter an International Market Entry was planned. This entailed the entry location (EL), entry timing (ET), and entry mode (EM). As it was previously explained, Aidx Medical BV will be the first mover and focused on a niche market on automated diagnostic device for veterinary health. Finally, the entry mode selected was indirect exports, meaning the company will sell the device through an intermediary. Finally, the strategy is described with the concept of 4P Marketing Mix (Mullins & Walker Jr., 2013)which includes product, price, place and promotion in conjunction the international entry market and the business model to ensure that the action plans within all are complimentary and aligned."",""subject topic"":""Business Model Canvas; Market Entry Strategy; 4PS Marketing Mix; African Market; Trypanosomiasis; Neglected Tropical Disease"",""language"":""en"",""publication type"":""master thesis"",""publisher"":null,""isbn"":null,""issn"":null,""patent"":null,""patent status"":null,""bibliographic note"":null,""access restriction"":null,""embargo date"":null,""faculty"":null,""department"":null,""research group"":null,""programme"":""Strategic Product Design"",""project"":null,""coordinates"":""1.37330, 32.29030""},{""uuid"":""uuid:3003d5d6-810a-40b4-8e5d-e41fc61fa17f"",""repository link"":""http:\/\/resolver.tudelft.nl\/uuid:3003d5d6-810a-40b4-8e5d-e41fc61fa17f"",""title"":""Inter- and intra-driver variability in lane change behaviour"",""author"":""Koppel, Christiaan (TU Delft Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering; TU Delft Cognitive Robotics)"",""contributor"":""Petermeijer, Bastiaan (mentor); Abbink, David (mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)"",""publication year"":2019,""abstract"":""Lane change manoeuvres are known to vary widely in lane change duration. This is thought to be an effect of the surrounding vehicles and personal preference of drivers. However, little is known about the effect on steering behaviour during a lane change manoeuvre. Moreover, the relation of the effect of traffic to inter- and intra-driver variability is unknown. This study focuses on quantifying inter- and intra-driver variability in lane change duration and steering behaviour during lane changes in two different traffic scenarios. In an exploratory study, 21 participants drove 30 lane change manoeuvres in a 6 DoF moving base driving simulator. Two scenarios were used: a closing gap in the target lane and a constant gap in the target lane, with 15 repetitions per scenario. The results show high inter-driver and intra-driver variability, for both lane change duration (M=6.34 s SD-inter=0.90 s SD-intra=1.26 s) and steering behaviour (e.g. maximum steering wheel angle M=4.14 deg SD-inter=1.62 deg SD-intra=1.34 deg). The effect of the scenario was not significant for lane change duration and maximum steering wheel angles. Additionally, it was shown that lane change duration only has a medium correlation with the maximum steering wheel angle (Pearson R(585)=-.48, p\\textless0.001). Furthermore, the mean and variability of the lane change duration decreased when lane changes were initiated with a shorter distance to the slow lead vehicle. Concluding, the lane change duration does not fully determine steering behaviour during a lane change, making it an unsuitable metric for determining human-like lane change trajectories. It is therefore proposed to create trajectories based on steering behaviour. It seems that drivers exhibit high variability in lane change behaviour when spatio-temporal criticality with respect to traffic is low. Higher spatio-temporal criticality limits the mean and variability of the lane change duration. Future work should determine whether this variability is the result of driver preference or indifference. Additionally, future work should implement and test human-like lane change trajectories based on steering behaviour as opposed to lane change duration."",""subject topic"":""Lane change manoeuvre; Driving simulator; Driving behaviour; Human-like driving"",""language"":""en"",""publication type"":""master thesis"",""publisher"":null,""isbn"":null,""issn"":null,""patent"":null,""patent status"":null,""bibliographic note"":null,""access restriction"":null,""embargo date"":null,""faculty"":null,""department"":null,""research group"":null,""programme"":""Mechanical Engineering | Vehicle Engineering"",""project"":null,""coordinates"":null},{""uuid"":""uuid:87d1d976-a0ba-40d2-8fa4-437bd65c5b91"",""repository link"":""http:\/\/resolver.tudelft.nl\/uuid:87d1d976-a0ba-40d2-8fa4-437bd65c5b91"",""title"":""Transverse 3D Electrical Properties Tomography"",""author"":""An, Xin (TU Delft Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science; TU Delft Circuits and Systems)"",""contributor"":""Remis, Rob (mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)"",""publication year"":2019,""abstract"":""MR-based Electrical Properties Tomography (EPT) is a medical imaging modality to reconstruct the electrical conductivity and permittivity inside the human body based on the magnetic field data obtained from an MRI system. Currently, 2D CSI-EPT implementation is able to generate reliable reconstructions under special assumption of electromagnetic fields, while 3D implementation of CSI-EPT is able to achieve accurate reconstruction. However, much effort is needed to reduce computational cost for practical application in a MRI setting. Several experiments show that the radiofrequency(RF) fields on the midplane of an birdcage RF coil is E-polarized. In this study, we assume that RF field is E-polarised in the midplane of the RF birdcage coil and no other field assumptions are imposed. The electromagnetic fields relations governed by Maxwell\u2019s equations in the birdcage RF coil are simplified by the negligibletransverse electric fields into two equations, referred to as midplane equations. In order to find the parameters that satisfy the midplane equations, an objective function is created by evaluating the difference between the measured and modeled data. A novel alternating-direction iterative method is proposed for minimizing the multivariate objective function where the electrical properties of biological tissues are retrieved in an iterative \u2019fix-one-optimize-for-the-other\u2019 way. Within each iteration, a two-step procedure is conducted by updating electric field parameter and dielectric parameter in turn. Three different optimization algorithms are implemented for updating the electric field parameter. The magnetic fields data for numerical simulations are generated by placing a male head model or a longitudinal uniform head model insidea simulated magnetic resonance scanner. The proposed methods are demonstrated by reconstructions from the simulated data, which are in good agreement with true electrical properties values. The study concludes with the selection of the following culvert array existing of 24 culverts measuring 9 m by 9 m executed with bidirectional turbines. From an economic feasibility study, wherein, amongst other involved parameters, an installed capacity of 36 MW, a market price of electricity of \u20ac 0.13 per kilowatt hour for the first 15 years and \u20ac 0.049 per kilowatt hour for the second 15 years and a loan period of 15 years, follows a payback period of 15 years and a levelised cost of energy value of \u20ac 0.058 per kilowatt hour.
